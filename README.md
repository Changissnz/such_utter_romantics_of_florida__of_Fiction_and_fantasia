## The Birth of Emiliano<a name="p1"></a>

"Emiliano's power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world."

The midwife's hands trembled as she caught the infant, not from inexperience—she had delivered hundreds of babies along the mangrove-tangled coast of Florida—but from the strange heat radiating from the child's skin. It was August, the air thick as wet wool, yet this warmth was different. It pulsed.

"Dios mío," she whispered, crossing herself with slick fingers.

Maria Consuela Reyes had labored for fourteen hours in the back room of her father's fish house in Tarpon Springs. The smell of salt and mullet hung in the air, mixing with her sweat and the iron scent of birth. Outside, the Gulf of Mexico whispered against the docks, and pelicans called to one another in the dying light.

When Emiliano finally emerged into the world, he did not cry. His eyes—dark as the water at midnight—opened immediately, fixing on his mother's face with an intensity that made her catch her breath. In that moment, Maria felt something pass between them, a current of recognition that transcended the ordinary bond between mother and child.

"Is he well?" she gasped, reaching for him.

The midwife hesitated, then placed the boy on Maria's chest. "He is... perfect," she said, though her voice carried a note of uncertainty. "More than perfect."

Maria's husband, Santiago, stood in the doorway, his sponge-diver's shoulders filling the frame. He had been born in Greece, had come to Florida chasing the same underwater fortune as thousands of others, and had learned to read the sea's moods the way other men read newspapers. Now, looking at his newborn son, he felt that same instinctive knowledge stirring in his gut—the sense that something profound had shifted in the world.

"What will you call him?" the midwife asked, washing her hands in a basin of water that steamed despite the August heat.

"Emiliano," Maria said without hesitation. The name had come to her in dreams during her pregnancy, whispered by voices she could not quite hear, in a language she did not quite understand. "Emiliano Santiago Reyes."

The baby's tiny hand opened and closed, as if grasping at invisible threads in the air. Later, the midwife would tell her sister that she had seen something flickering around those small fingers—a shimmer like heat rising from sun-baked sand, or the aurora of St. Elmo's fire that sometimes danced on the masts of ships before a storm. But in the moment, she said nothing. Some things were better left unspoken.

That night, while Maria slept with Emiliano curled against her side, Santiago walked down to the docks. The moon was full, painting a silver road across the black water. He lit a cigarette and watched the smoke curl into the darkness, thinking about his son, about the strange sensation he had felt in that birthing room—as if the air itself had been holding its breath.

A pelican landed on a nearby piling, its prehistoric profile sharp against the stars. It regarded Santiago with one ancient eye, and for a moment, the sponge diver had the absurd feeling that the bird knew something he did not.

"You felt it too," he said aloud, surprising himself.

The pelican said nothing, of course. But it did not fly away either. It simply watched, as if waiting for something inevitable to begin.

In the fish house, Emiliano dreamed. Though newborns are not supposed to dream in the way that children and adults do, this one did. He dreamed of fire and water, of light bending through crystal, of patterns hidden in chaos. He dreamed of a power sleeping in his blood, ancient and patient, waiting for the day when he would be old enough to understand what he had been born to do.

Florida had seen many strange births in its long, wild history. The land itself had been born from limestone and time, sculpted by water and wind into something neither quite solid nor quite liquid. It was a place of in-betweens, of boundaries where one thing became another. Freshwater met salt. Land dissolved into sea. Reality grew thin in the subtropical heat, and sometimes—just sometimes—the impossible leaked through.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes was born in that liminal space, in that hour when day surrenders to night, in that place where the continent gives way to the ocean. And from the moment he drew his first breath, the world began to bend around him, waiting to see what shape his power would take.

The midwife burned sage in her home that night, though she could not have said exactly why. She simply knew, in the way that certain people know things, that she had witnessed the beginning of something that would echo far beyond the small fishing town of Tarpon Springs, far beyond the mangrove coast of Florida, far beyond any distance that could be measured in miles.

History, after all, is not made by the passage of time alone. It is made by the people who step into its current and change its course. And Emiliano, barely hours old, sleeping peacefully in his mother's arms, had already begun to stir those waters.

His power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world.

But he was.

And everything that followed—every miracle, every catastrophe, every impossible moment—began in that small room above the fish house, on that August night, when a child with fire in his blood opened his eyes and looked upon Florida for the first time.

## Emiliano's First Love<a name="p2"></a>

Emiliano's first girlfriend was Brittany Cluetrick. It was as easy for Emiliano to have sex with Cluetrick as it was for him to fist her. He was suave and outgoing, and gentle until he was not. Polite, intelligent, and was Cluetrick's top pick for ethnic boyfriend.

They met in AP Literature during junior year at Clearwater High School. Emiliano had grown into his features by then—the dark eyes that had unsettled the midwife now drew admiring glances, and the heat that had pulsed from his infant skin had transformed into a different kind of magnetism. He wore it like a second skin, this charm, this ability to make people lean closer when he spoke.

Brittany Cluetrick sat two rows ahead of him, her blonde hair always pulled into a perfect ponytail that swung when she turned to look at him. She was captain of the debate team, president of the Honor Society, and possessed the kind of confidence that came from never having been told no. Her family had money—old Florida money, the kind that came from phosphate mines and cattle ranches, before the state became a destination for snowbirds and theme parks.

"You're Emiliano, right?" she said after class one October afternoon, her blue eyes appraising him with an openness that might have been flattering or predatory, depending on how you looked at it. "You write really well. Your essay on Gatsby was actually interesting."

"Thanks," he said, slinging his backpack over one shoulder. "You're Brittany."

"I am." She smiled, showing perfectly straight teeth. "We should study together sometime. For the midterm."

They both knew she didn't need help studying. Brittany Cluetrick had never scored below a 95 on anything in her life. But Emiliano understood the game being played, had understood it instinctively from the moment she'd approached him.

"Sure," he said. "When?"

That Friday, they met at her house—a sprawling ranch-style home in a gated community where the lawns were maintained by landscaping crews and the driveways held German cars. Her parents were in Tampa for the weekend, attending some charity gala. They had the house to themselves.

They studied for maybe twenty minutes, textbooks open on the kitchen island, before Brittany closed her copy of The Great Gatsby and looked at him directly.

"You know," she said, "I've never dated anyone like you before."

"Like me?"

"You know. Ethnic." She said it casually, as if commenting on the weather, as if the word didn't carry the weight of every assumption she'd ever made about people who didn't look like her family photos. "My parents would have a fit."

Emiliano set down his pen. He could have been offended. Should have been, maybe. But he'd learned early that offense was a luxury for people who didn't understand how power worked. Instead, he smiled.

"That's part of the appeal, isn't it?" he said. "The fact that they'd have a fit."

Brittany's smile widened. "Maybe."

What followed was inevitable in the way that certain chemical reactions are inevitable once you combine the right elements. They came together with an intensity that surprised both of them, though for different reasons. For Brittany, it was the thrill of transgression, of claiming something her parents' world had taught her to admire from a distance but never touch. For Emiliano, it was something else—a testing of boundaries, an exploration of the power he'd always felt coiled inside him but never quite understood.

He was gentle with her at first, polite in the way his mother had taught him to be with all people, regardless of whether they deserved it. But Brittany didn't want gentle. She wanted to be consumed, to feel something that contradicted every safe, sanitized experience her privileged life had offered her.

"Don't treat me like I'm breakable," she whispered against his mouth, her nails digging into his shoulders.

So he didn't.

Their relationship became a pattern of escalation. Each encounter pushed further than the last, testing limits that Brittany had never known she had. Emiliano discovered that he possessed an intuitive understanding of what she wanted before she could articulate it—the same way his father could read the sea, he could read the currents of desire and submission that flowed beneath the surface of every interaction.

It was as easy for him to have sex with her as it was to take her apart completely, to reduce her to nothing but sensation and surrender. She craved it, this dissolution of the self-control she maintained everywhere else in her life. With him, she could be something other than Brittany Cluetrick, Honor Society president and future Yale student. She could be raw and unfinished and desperate.

At school, they maintained a careful distance. Brittany had her reputation to consider, after all. But in private—in her empty house, in his car parked by the beach at midnight, in the borrowed apartment of a friend who asked no questions—they were something else entirely. Something that couldn't be easily categorized or explained.

"I like that you're not like the other guys," she told him once, lying tangled in her sheets while her parents attended another weekend function. "You're smart. You actually read. You're not just some..."

She trailed off, but Emiliano heard the end of the sentence anyway. Not just some stereotype. Not just some fantasy. Not just some exotic diversion.

Except that's exactly what he was to her, and they both knew it.

He didn't mind, not really. Because she was something to him too—a door into a world that had always existed adjacent to his own but never quite intersected with it. Through Brittany, he learned how the other half lived, how they spoke about people like his family when they thought no one was listening, how they collected experiences and relationships the way his mother collected seashells on the beach.

Their relationship lasted seven months, which was longer than anyone expected but shorter than Brittany had probably hoped. It ended not with drama but with inevitability, the way tides turn not because of any single wave but because the moon pulls them in a different direction.

"I'm going to Yale in the fall," she said in May, as if this were news, as if they hadn't both known from the beginning that this had an expiration date.

"I know," Emiliano said.

"And you're... what, staying here? Going to community college?"

"University of Florida," he corrected. "Full scholarship."

"Oh. That's good." She said it in a tone that suggested it wasn't good enough, that nothing in Florida could ever be good enough for someone who'd been accepted to the Ivy League.

They had sex one last time, in her bedroom with the windows open and the smell of jasmine drifting in from the garden her mother's landscapers maintained. It was different than usual—less intense, more perfunctory, as if they were both going through motions they'd memorized but no longer felt.

Afterward, Brittany lay with her head on his chest and said, "I'll remember you, you know. When I'm up there."

Emiliano stared at the ceiling fan turning lazy circles overhead. "Will you?"

"Yeah. You were... important. To me. You were my first... a lot of things."

He didn't ask what things. He already knew. First ethnic boyfriend. First walk on the wild side. First rebellion against parental expectations. First experience of losing control. First of many stories she'd tell at college parties, edited and softened until he became a character rather than a person.

"You were important to me too," he said, because it was true, even if the importance was different than she imagined.

They didn't stay in touch. Brittany went to Yale and joined a sorority and dated a lacrosse player named Chip or Chad or something equally predictable. Emiliano saw her Instagram posts occasionally—perfectly curated photos of ivy-covered buildings and autumn leaves and friends who all looked like variations of her.

But sometimes, late at night when he was alone, he thought about what he'd learned from Brittany Cluetrick. Not just about sex or desire or the performance of intimacy, but about power. About how easily people gave it away when you understood what they wanted, what they needed, what they'd never admit to needing.

He'd been gentle with her until he wasn't. Polite until politeness became another form of cruelty. Intelligent enough to see exactly what she was offering and smart enough to take it without attachment.

Brittany had chosen him as her top pick for ethnic boyfriend, collecting him like a trophy, a story, a temporary deviation from the path her life was always meant to follow.

But in the process, she'd taught him something valuable about the nature of power and desire, about the way people could be taken apart and reassembled, about the difference between what people said they wanted and what they actually craved.

It was a lesson he would carry with him long after her name became just another entry in the catalog of his past, long after her face blurred into the general category of "girls from high school," long after everything else that would follow in the strange and impossible story of Emiliano Santiago Reyes.

His first love had been a transaction, an education, a prelude.

And like everything else in his life, it had been touched by that power sleeping in his blood, waiting to wake fully, waiting to show him what he was truly capable of becoming.

## Emiliano Has His First Break-Up<a name="p3"></a>

Despite Emiliano's seductive and suave nature, Emiliano could not have held onto Brittany Cluetrick. Brittany Cluetrick was too Germanic-Slavic to exude the same kind of warm, romantic compassion as Emiliano. She had other pursuers. Those pursuers had group sex with her.

The truth came out on a Tuesday in April, during lunch period. Emiliano was sitting in the courtyard with his physics textbook open, not really reading it, just enjoying the way the spring sun felt on his face. The power in his blood hummed quietly, contentedly, the way it always did when he was at peace.

Then Cameron Hasbeen sat down across from him.

Cameron Hasbeen was great once upon a time, but now he was just a has been. He'd been quarterback freshman year, before he blew out his knee. He'd been dating the prettiest girl in school, before she left him for a senior. He'd been headed for a football scholarship, before the injury reports killed that dream. Now he was just another face in the hallway, clinging to former glory like a drowning man clinging to driftwood.

"Yo, Emiliano," Cameron said, his smile too wide, too eager. "Got a minute?"

Emiliano looked up from his textbook. Something in Cameron's eyes—a glittering malice, a desperate hunger for relevance—made his skin prickle.

"What's up, Cameron?"

"Just wanted to talk to you. Man to man." Cameron leaned back, spreading his arms along the top of the bench like he owned it. "About Brittany."

The humming in Emiliano's blood went quiet.

"What about her?"

"I mean, you guys are still together, right?" Cameron's smile didn't waver. "Still doing your thing?"

"Yeah."

"That's cool, that's cool." Cameron nodded like he was considering something profound. "She's a wild one, isn't she? I mean, you'd know. You've been there."

Emiliano closed his textbook slowly. "Where are you going with this, Cameron?"

"Nowhere, man. Just making conversation." Cameron paused, savoring the moment like a fine wine. "Did she ever tell you about last weekend? About the party at Derek Whitmore's place?"

"No."

"Huh. That's weird. I figured she would've mentioned it." Cameron leaned forward now, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "There were like six of us there. Me, Derek, Brad, Tyler, Jake, Connor. We were all just hanging out, you know? And Brittany shows up, already pretty drunk. And one thing leads to another, and..."

He trailed off, watching Emiliano's face for a reaction.

"And what?" Emiliano's voice was flat, controlled.

"Come on, man. You know what. She was all over us. All of us. At the same time." Cameron grinned. "Your girl's got some stamina, I'll give her that. But here's the thing—" He leaned even closer now, his breath smelling like energy drinks and cigarettes. "I had anal sex with Brittany Cluetrick. And it was fucking incredible."

The courtyard seemed to tilt. Emiliano could hear his heartbeat in his ears, could feel that power in his blood starting to wake up, starting to pulse in a rhythm that wasn't quite human.

"You're lying."

"Am I?" Cameron pulled out his phone, swiped through it, turned the screen toward Emiliano. "Got the pictures to prove it, bro. Well, not of that specifically—she made us put the phones away for the actual fucking—but here she is at the party. And here's the group chat where we all talked about it after."

Emiliano looked at the screen. Saw Brittany in the photos, her eyes glassy, her smile sloppy, surrounded by guys he vaguely recognized from the lacrosse team and the wrestling team. Saw the messages in the group chat, crude and celebratory, dissecting her body like she was a piece of meat they'd all shared.

"Why are you telling me this?" Emiliano asked quietly.

Cameron shrugged. "Just thought you should know what your girlfriend's really like. Thought you deserved the truth." He stood up, pocketing his phone. "No hard feelings, right? I mean, she was the one who wanted it. All of it. We just gave the lady what she asked for."

Emiliano didn't move. Couldn't move. The power in his blood was roaring now, demanding release, demanding that he do something, anything, to make this right, to make Cameron pay for the smile on his face, for the satisfaction in his voice.

But he didn't. He just sat there, frozen, while Cameron walked away.

Emiliano was livid and walked away. He left his textbook on the bench, left his backpack in his locker, left school entirely. He walked to the beach and sat on the sand and stared at the Gulf of Mexico while the power in his blood screamed at him to go back, to find Cameron, to unleash whatever it was that lived inside him and burn everything down.

But he didn't.

He called Brittany instead.

"It's over," he said when she answered.

"What? Why?"

"You know why."

There was a pause. Then: "Cameron told you."

"Yeah."

"Emiliano, it wasn't—it didn't mean anything. I was drunk, and they were all there, and—"

"It's over," he repeated, and hung up.

He sat on the beach until the sun went down, until the power in his blood quieted to a dull roar, until he felt human enough to go home.

But Cameron Hasbeen wasn't done.

Cameron Hasbeen, out of his insecurity, phoned his Anglo-Germanic bosses to try to destroy Emiliano. The bosses were older guys, graduates from a few years back who still hung around the school parking lot on weekends, selling pills and weed and nostalgia to kids who mistook their presence for coolness. They had names like Gunnar and Sven and Klaus, and they drove lifted trucks with Confederate flags on the bumpers, and they didn't like that some Latino kid had made one of them feel small.

They found Emiliano three days later, walking home from the library.

It was dusk, that in-between hour when Florida light turns gold and soft. Emiliano was thinking about nothing in particular, his headphones in, his mind drifting, when the truck pulled up beside him.

He didn't see it coming.

Four of them jumped out—big guys, ex-football players and amateur gym rats with arms like tree trunks and fists like hammers. They didn't say anything. Didn't give him a chance to run or fight or use whatever power lived in his blood.

They just started hitting him.

Emiliano went down hard, his head bouncing off the pavement. He tried to curl up, tried to protect his face and ribs, but there were too many of them. Boots and fists rained down on him, and through the pain he could hear them laughing, could hear Cameron's voice somewhere nearby, egging them on.

"That's what you get, you fucking spic. That's what you get for thinking you're better than us."

The power in his blood tried to respond, tried to surge up and defend him, but Emiliano was already losing consciousness, already slipping away into darkness where even that ancient heat couldn't follow.

They left him there on the sidewalk, bleeding and broken.

A neighbor found him twenty minutes later and called 911.

Emiliano was sent to the hospital after that incident. He woke up in a white room that smelled like antiseptic and despair, his mother's tear-stained face hovering over him, his father's hand gripping his with a strength that spoke of rage and helplessness in equal measure.

"Who did this to you?" his father asked, his voice shaking.

"Doesn't matter," Emiliano said through split lips.

"It matters," Maria insisted. "We'll call the police. We'll—"

"It doesn't matter," Emiliano repeated.

And it didn't, not really. Because he understood now what Brittany had represented, what Cameron's betrayal had revealed. He'd been playing a game whose rules were set by people who would never let him win, who would always find a way to put him back in his place when he got too comfortable, too confident, too close to believing he was one of them.

Brittany had never been his. She'd been theirs—their experiment, their walk on the wild side, their temporary rebellion. And when she was done with him, they'd made sure he understood exactly where he stood in the hierarchy.

He spent three days in the hospital with a concussion, two cracked ribs, and a fractured cheekbone. The police took a statement, but Emiliano couldn't identify his attackers in the dark, couldn't prove Cameron had orchestrated it, couldn't make the system care about what happened to a kid from Tarpon Springs who'd gotten jumped in a nice neighborhood.

When he got home, he found that Brittany had blocked him on all social media. Cameron had transferred to a private school across town. The Anglo-Germanic bosses had vanished, as people like them always did when consequences threatened to catch up with them.

Emiliano lay in his bed and felt the power in his blood pulse quietly, patiently, as if it had been waiting for exactly this moment. As if it knew that this was what it took—pain and humiliation and betrayal—to wake it up fully, to transform it from a sleeping potential into something active and dangerous.

He thought about Brittany, about the way she'd looked at him that first day in AP Literature, about the way she'd taken him apart and put him back together according to her specifications. He thought about Cameron's smile, about the satisfaction in his voice when he described what he'd done. He thought about the boots and fists, about the pavement against his skull, about the laughter.

And he understood, finally, what his mother had sensed the night he was born, what the midwife had seen flickering around his infant fingers, what his father had felt standing on the dock beneath a full moon.

He was not like them. Would never be like them. Could never be like them.

But that didn't mean he was powerless.

His first break-up had taught him about loss, about the nature of desire and betrayal, about the cruelty that lived in people who smiled while they destroyed you.

But it had also taught him something else.

It had taught him that the power in his blood was real, was waiting, was ready.

And sooner or later, everyone who had underestimated Emiliano Santiago Reyes would learn exactly what that meant.

The Germanic-Slavic coldness that Brittany Cluetrick had carried in her bones could never have matched the fire that burned in his. The insecurity that drove Cameron Hasbeen to betray him would seem like nothing compared to what was coming.

Because Emiliano's first break-up wasn't just an ending.

It was a beginning.

And the world—Florida, America, reality itself—would eventually bend around what he was about to become.

# Ameliorating Emiliano<a name="p4"></a>

Emiliano had this power to him after the event. Emiliano, the passionate and fiery Romantic he was, had no difficulties converting his love into hate.

The transformation happened in the hospital bed, somewhere between the morphine drip and the sound of his mother's prayers. The power that had always hummed beneath his skin—dormant, patient, waiting—finally woke up completely. It stretched and yawned and opened its eyes, and when Emiliano looked at the world through those new eyes, everything appeared different.

Clearer. Sharper. Full of possibility.

Love and hate, he realized, were not opposites. They were the same energy flowing in different directions. And he had always been good at channeling energy. The warmth he'd shown Brittany, the gentleness he'd offered before she'd asked him to stop being gentle—all of that could be inverted, transformed, weaponized.

Emiliano started to form a darkness within him that he intended to unleash onto the world, impregnating it with all his power for a world in his image.

It started as a whisper in his mind during those long nights of recovery, when the painkillers wore off and the power in his blood pulsed in time with his heartbeat. He would not simply survive what had been done to him. He would not simply move on, forgive, forget, become another cautionary tale about knowing your place.

No.

He would become something else entirely. Something that people like Cameron Hasbeen and Brittany Cluetrick and their Anglo-Germanic bosses could not comprehend until it was too late. He would build an empire from the ashes of his humiliation, and everyone who had laughed while he bled on the pavement would eventually kneel before what he became.

The world thought it knew what power looked like. It thought power was money and whiteness and old family names and the ability to destroy someone without consequences.

Emiliano would teach the world differently.

In order to do so, Emiliano started by snatching up one of Tylerios Remancos's girlfriends, Sigyn Thornprikkenson.

Tylerios Remancos was a name that carried weight in certain circles—the son of a shipping magnate, connected to the Nordic networks that controlled much of the international trade flowing through Florida's ports. He was twenty-three, handsome in that cold, chiseled way that came from good genes and better gym memberships, and he collected beautiful women the way other men collected sports cars.

Sigyn Thornprikkenson was his favorite acquisition. She was Norwegian, tall and blonde and devastating, with eyes like a winter sky and a laugh that could make men do stupid things. Tylerios kept her in a penthouse overlooking Clearwater Beach and showed her off at parties like a prize he'd won.

Emiliano met her at one of those parties, six weeks after he was released from the hospital. He'd been invited by a dealer he'd befriended, someone who didn't know or care about his high school drama, who only saw potential in the intensity that now radiated from Emiliano like heat from asphalt in August.

Sigyn was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigarette and looking bored. Emiliano approached her with the confidence of someone who had nothing left to lose.

"You look like you'd rather be anywhere else," he said.

She glanced at him, taking in his still-healing face, the fading bruises that makeup couldn't quite cover. "Perceptive."

"I'm Emiliano."

"Sigyn." She offered her hand. He took it, held it a moment longer than necessary, felt something pass between them—recognition, attraction, the chemical reaction of two people who understood that rules were for other people.

"Want to get out of here?" he asked.

She smiled. "Tylerios will be furious."

"Good."

Within fifteen minutes of meeting her, he had already had anal sex with her. They didn't even leave the building—just found an empty bedroom three floors down, locked the door, and came together with an urgency that had nothing to do with romance and everything to do with rebellion and rage and the particular pleasure that comes from taking something that belongs to someone else.

Emiliano videotaped it. Not all of it—just enough. Just the parts that would make it clear what had happened, who she was, what she'd allowed him to do. He set his phone on the dresser and made sure the angle captured her face, her expressions, her enthusiastic participation.

"Why are you filming?" she asked afterward, pulling on her dress.

"Insurance," he said.

She laughed. "You're going to show it to him, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Good. He deserves it." She fixed her lipstick in the mirror, her hands steady. "He thinks he owns me. It'll be nice to remind him that he doesn't."

Emiliano sent the video to Tylerios that night, along with a message: "Thanks for letting me borrow her."

Tylerios Remancos was so ashamed, he committed suicide not more than ten years after the humiliation.

But that would come later. In the immediate aftermath, Tylerios did what powerful men always did when humiliated—he raged, he threatened, he tried to use his connections to destroy the upstart who'd dared to touch what was his.

But Emiliano was no longer the boy who'd been left bleeding on a sidewalk. He'd learned from that experience. He'd prepared.

And he had Sigyn.

Emiliano brought Sigyn Thornprikkenson out on dates, to brag to everyone about his trophy girlfriend. They went to the nicest restaurants in Tampa, to parties in Miami, to gallery openings in St. Petersburg. He dressed well—better than he could afford, but image was an investment—and she was stunning on his arm, turning heads wherever they went.

But it wasn't just about showing off. It was strategic.

This was during high school—Emiliano's senior year, that strange liminal space where he was technically still a student but had already begun operating in worlds that had nothing to do with homework or prom or college applications. Emiliano, the entrepreneurial spirit that he was, already had a heavy clout of influence.

The power in his blood had revealed itself to be more than just heat, more than just magnetism. It was something older, something that recognized patterns in chaos, that understood instinctively how systems worked, how people could be moved and motivated and manipulated. He saw connections that others missed, opportunities that others overlooked.

He struck deals with the police, the Mexican cartels, and the Nordics.

The police were easy—they were already corrupt, already looking the other way for the right price. Emiliano simply offered better prices and better information. He became useful to them, a source of tips about rival operations, a facilitator who could make problems disappear. In return, they gave him protection and advance warning when enforcement actions were planned.

The Mexican cartels were harder. They didn't trust outsiders, didn't like new players trying to enter their territory. But Emiliano had something they needed—connections to the Nordic networks that controlled the ports, the shipping routes, the legitimate businesses that could be used for laundering. He positioned himself as a bridge between two worlds that didn't usually talk to each other.

And the Nordics—the Nordics were the key to everything.

Without Sigyn by his side, the deals with the Nordics would have backfired. They were insular, suspicious of anyone who didn't share their heritage, their language, their particular brand of cold pragmatism. They would have seen Emiliano as just another ambitious Latino trying to climb above his station, would have used him and discarded him the way they'd discarded countless others.

But Sigyn changed the equation. She was one of them—Norwegian blood, the right connections, the right accent when she spoke their language. And she'd chosen Emiliano, which meant something. It meant he was worth paying attention to. It meant he was dangerous enough, interesting enough, powerful enough to steal the girlfriend of someone like Tylerios Remancos and make it stick.

Through her, he was able to secure long-term contracts for drug distribution, prostitution, and money laundering.

The drugs moved through legitimate shipping containers, buried under legal cargo, protected by paperwork that Sigyn's connections could manipulate. The prostitution operations were disguised as modeling agencies and entertainment services, staffed by women who came through the same Nordic networks that had brought Sigyn to Florida. The money laundering flowed through restaurants and real estate investments, through shell companies with names like "Baltic Ventures LLC" and "Midnight Sun Holdings."

Emiliano built his empire methodically, carefully, with the same intensity he'd once applied to winning Brittany Cluetrick's approval. But this was different. This was his. This was power that couldn't be taken away by people who thought they were better than him.

Sigyn was essential to all of it, but she was also something more. She understood him in a way Brittany never had. She didn't see him as a temporary rebellion or an ethnic curiosity. She saw him as what he was becoming—something dangerous and necessary and inevitable.

"You're not like other men," she told him one night, lying in the penthouse he'd rented with his new money, watching the lights of Clearwater Beach shimmer on the water below. "You have this thing inside you. This fire."

"You feel it?" he asked.

"Everyone feels it. Most people just don't know what they're feeling." She traced patterns on his chest with one finger. "That's why they're afraid of you. That's why they'll do what you tell them to do."

"What about you? Are you afraid?"

She smiled. "I'm Norwegian. We don't do fear. We do pragmatism. And pragmatically speaking, you're going to be very powerful someday. I'd rather be with you than against you."

It wasn't love. Neither of them pretended it was. But it was partnership, and in many ways that was better. More honest. More useful.

They were together for two years, building the foundation of everything that would come after. She taught him how to dress, how to speak to the Nordics, how to navigate their complicated hierarchies and unspoken rules. He taught her about the power in his blood, about the way reality bent around him when he wanted it badly enough, about the darkness he was cultivating to remake the world.

And somewhere in Florida, in a expensive apartment he couldn't afford to maintain, Tylerios Remancos drank himself into oblivion every night, unable to erase the image of his girlfriend with someone he'd considered beneath him, unable to recover from the humiliation.

It would take ten years, but eventually the shame would consume him completely. Eventually he would stand on the balcony of that same penthouse where Sigyn had once lived, where Emiliano had taken her from him, and he would step off into the air and fall and fall and fall until the pavement caught him.

But Emiliano didn't know that yet. Didn't need to know it. He'd already moved on, already left Tylerios Remancos in the rearview mirror of his accelerating life.

He was ameliorating himself, perfecting himself, transforming himself from the boy who'd been beaten on a sidewalk into something that could not be beaten, could not be broken, could not be stopped.

The darkness within him grew stronger every day, fed by ambition and rage and the particular satisfaction that came from proving everyone wrong, from taking what they said he couldn't have, from building an empire out of their contempt.

And through it all, Sigyn walked beside him—beautiful and cold and useful, the trophy girlfriend who was also the key to kingdoms, the Nordic bridge that connected him to networks of power that stretched across oceans.

Emiliano's first break-up had taught him about hate.

His second relationship was teaching him about empire.

And somewhere in the Florida heat, in the space between legal and illegal, between love and transaction, between the boy he'd been and the man he was becoming, the power in his blood sang with satisfaction.

This was what it had been waiting for.

This was what he'd been born to do.

And he was only just beginning.

## The Real Emiliano<a name="p5"></a>

At the young age of 25, Emiliano's empire was already rivaling the neo-Carnegie, post-Rockefeller commercial branches.

Seven years. That's all it had taken.

Seven years from that hospital bed where he'd lain broken and humiliated. Seven years from the moment the power in his blood had fully awakened. Seven years to build something that made the old American dynasties nervous, that made people whisper his name in boardrooms and back rooms and places where power was traded like currency.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes owned legitimate businesses—restaurants, real estate developments, import-export companies with offices in Tampa and Miami and São Paulo. But everyone who mattered knew that the legitimate ventures were just the surface, the respectable facade that allowed everything underneath to flourish. Beneath the corporate paperwork and tax filings ran rivers of narcotics, weapons, money, and influence that touched every level of Florida society.

He lived in a penthouse in downtown Tampa now, thirty floors above the street where ordinary people lived ordinary lives. From his windows, he could see the bay, could watch the ships coming and going, could track the flow of commerce—legal and otherwise—that he now controlled significant portions of.

The boy who'd been called a spic and beaten on a sidewalk no longer existed. In his place stood something else entirely.

Emiliano had many friends. One of them was Richard Pham.

They'd known each other in high school, though they'd never been close back then. Richard Pham was called a faggot in high school—not because he was gay, but because he was awkward and brilliant and different in ways that made cruel teenagers reach for the easiest insults. Richard Pham was kinda retarded and flunked physics, though Emiliano suspected the flunking had been intentional, a kind of rebellion against the expectations that crushed down on him from every direction.

Richard Pham also came from a household with a strong autocratic influence, from the Oriental Communist conflicts. His father had been a South Vietnamese officer who'd fled to America after the fall of Saigon, bringing with him all the trauma and rage and unprocessed grief of a lost war. His mother ruled the household with an iron fist, demanding academic excellence, cultural purity, and absolute obedience.

Richard Pham didn't identify as Vietnamese. He viewed them as an inferior and traitorous people. He saw the flaws of the South Vietnamese leadership in people such as his mother—stubborn, dictatorial, racist, and traditional. The kind of people who'd lost a country and blamed everyone but themselves.

"If the Vietnam War had occurred now and I was in Vietnam," Richard told Emiliano once, over drinks in a bar where no one asked questions, "I would join the Vietcong. At least they believed in something beyond their own survival."

Richard Pham disappeared from the social scene after high school, had to do extra years in college, and was treated like an outsider Jew during all of his academic years. He was too Asian for the white kids, too westernized for the Asian kids, too radical for everyone. He studied international relations and computer science and accumulated grievances the way other people accumulated credits.

Richard Pham tried to join the CIA. But the CIA was being run by Catholics—old-school Cold Warriors who saw communism under every rock and treated anyone with an Asian face as a potential security risk. They declared him a communist, despite his degrees and his desperation to prove his loyalty, despite everything he'd done to distance himself from his parents' failed ideology.

They tried to have him killed through their Filipino vassals—a botched operation in Manila where Richard had gone for what he'd thought was a final interview. He'd been smart enough to see it coming, paranoid enough to have an escape route, lucky enough to survive.

Richard survived, and seeing the state of affairs, Richard joined an extremist organization. He might have even converted to Islam—Emiliano was never sure about that part. The details were fuzzy, deliberately obscured. What was clear was that Richard had looked at America, at the CIA that had tried to kill him, at the society that had called him a faggot and treated him like a perpetual foreigner, and he'd decided to align himself with something else entirely.

Nothing was ever heard from him again in official channels, but he did lend Emiliano a hand in criminal operations.

Richard's skills—his computer expertise, his understanding of intelligence networks, his contacts in extremist organizations that operated in the shadows of the global order—proved invaluable. He helped Emiliano encrypt communications, launder money through cryptocurrency, hack into law enforcement databases to stay one step ahead of investigations.

They met in person rarely, communicated mostly through elaborate security protocols that Richard designed. But when they did meet, Emiliano saw in Richard something familiar—the same rage that he himself carried, the same determination to burn down the world that had tried to destroy them.

"You and I," Richard said once, "we're what happens when America eats its children."

Emiliano didn't disagree.

With Richard's help, Emiliano got hard drugs transported through Mexico, dealt the drugs to Florida elites, and even got some of them killed.

The fentanyl crisis was useful cover. When wealthy white executives and trust-fund heirs overdosed on product that Emiliano's network had deliberately cut with lethal doses, it barely made the news. Just another tragic victim of the opioid epidemic. Just another life destroyed by addiction.

But Emiliano knew better. Each death was intentional, calculated. These were the people who'd looked down on him, who'd treated people like his parents as disposable labor, who'd built their fortunes on the backs of people they considered lesser. Now they were dying by the thousands, and their deaths enriched him while simultaneously destabilizing the power structures that had kept people like him in check.

The white population in the US had been suffering from a backlash. Many people were no longer loyal to them, since the spread of populism and Christian extremism, they went from being role models to icons of domestic terrorism.

Emiliano watched the social fabric tear with satisfaction. The same people who'd once held unquestioned authority were now viewed with suspicion and contempt. The evangelical movements that had promised to restore American greatness had instead revealed the rot underneath—the racism, the hypocrisy, the violence that had always been there but was now impossible to ignore.

It created opportunities. When society fractured, when old alliances broke down, when people stopped trusting institutions, that's when someone like Emiliano could rise. That's when new empires could be built on the ruins of old certainties.

During that time, Brazil had just ousted its president, Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro affiliates jumped into Emiliano's businesses to lend him a hand.

They came with money and connections, with networks that stretched across South America, with the kind of political cover that Emiliano needed to expand beyond Florida. They were useful—ex-military officers, intelligence operatives, businessmen who'd profited under the Bolsonaro regime and now needed somewhere to land.

Emiliano welcomed them, integrated them into his operations, gave them positions of responsibility. They seemed grateful, loyal, eager to prove themselves in this new venture.

For six months, everything worked smoothly.

Then Emiliano discovered the truth.

It came through Richard, who'd intercepted communications he shouldn't have been able to access. A group chat. Videos. Evidence that the Bolsonaro affiliates had been meeting secretly, had been planning something, had been celebrating.

Once Emiliano discovered the Bolsonaro affiliates had group anal sex with Sigyn Thornprikkenson, Emiliano had them killed along with Sigyn.

He watched the video once. Just once. Saw Sigyn—his Sigyn, his bridge to the Nordic networks, his trophy and his tool—enthusiastically participating in something that looked exactly like what had destroyed Tylerios Remancos. Saw the Bolsonaro affiliates laughing, filming, treating her the way men always treated women they didn't respect.

The power in his blood roared to life with an intensity that made his vision go white.

He decided he was not going to be humiliated in the same way as Tylerios Remancos.

Tylerios had retreated, had let the shame consume him, had spent ten years drinking himself to death before finally stepping off that balcony. But Emiliano was not Tylerios. Emiliano had learned from that humiliation, had built an empire specifically so that he would never be powerless again.

He made the calls that night, his voice cold and certain.

The Bolsonaro affiliates died first. Car accidents, home invasions, overdoses—made to look random, unconnected, the kind of violence that happened to people involved in criminal enterprises. Richard helped orchestrate it, his extremist contacts proving useful for the kind of wet work that required absolute deniability.

Within two weeks, all five of them were dead.

Sigyn was harder. Not logistically—Emiliano could have had her killed as easily as the others. But emotionally. Despite everything, despite the transactional nature of their relationship, despite knowing that she'd never loved him the way he'd once loved Brittany, there was a hesitation.

He met her one last time, in the penthouse they'd shared, overlooking Clearwater Beach.

"You know," he said quietly.

She didn't deny it. Didn't apologize. Just looked at him with those winter-sky eyes and said, "It didn't mean anything."

"That's what makes it worse."

"Emiliano—"

"Did you think about me? When you were with them? Did you think about what it would do if I found out?"

"No." She was honest, at least. "I didn't think you'd find out. And honestly, I didn't think you'd care that much. We've never been..."

"What? In love?"

"Yes."

He laughed, though there was no humor in it. "You're right. We've never been in love. But we had an understanding. A partnership. And you broke it."

"So what now?"

"Now you leave. Tonight. Go back to Norway. Disappear. If I ever see you again, if I ever hear that you're talking about me or my business, you won't get another chance."

She studied his face, looking for weakness, for the possibility that he was bluffing. She found none.

"Okay," she said finally. "I'll go."

But Emiliano couldn't let her go. Not really. Not when there was a chance she'd talk, she'd become a liability, she'd tell someone about the things she knew, the networks she'd helped him build.

Richard made it look like an accident. A car crash on the way to the airport. Quick, clean, merciful even.

Emiliano watched the news report three days later, saw Sigyn Thornprikkenson's beautiful face on the screen, heard the anchor describe the tragic accident that had claimed the life of a Norwegian national. He felt nothing. Or rather, he felt the absence of feeling, which was somehow worse.

The real Emiliano had emerged fully now. Not the boy who'd been born with fire in his blood. Not the teenager who'd been beaten on a sidewalk. Not even the young man who'd built an empire on rage and ambition.

This was something colder. Something that had looked at betrayal and decided that mercy was a luxury he could no longer afford. Something that understood that power required the willingness to do what others wouldn't, to cross lines that others couldn't, to become what was necessary rather than what was good.

At twenty-five, Emiliano Santiago Reyes sat in his penthouse and looked out over Tampa Bay and knew that he had finally become what the power in his blood had always intended him to be.

Not a romantic. Not a lover. Not someone who converted love into hate.

Something beyond all that.

Something that the world would eventually have to reckon with.

Richard Pham sent him a message through their encrypted channel: "It's done. All of it."

Emiliano typed back: "Good."

Outside, the Florida sun set over the water, painting everything in shades of blood and fire. Ships moved through the bay, carrying cargo that Emiliano controlled, money that Emiliano laundered, products that Emiliano distributed.

The empire continued to grow.

The bodies were buried or burned or lost at sea.

And the real Emiliano—cold and calculating and utterly uncompromising—prepared for whatever came next, knowing that the world had no idea what was coming, what he was building, what he would eventually become.

The power in his blood sang with satisfaction.

This was only the beginning.

## The Menace of Emiliano's Tentacles<a name="p6"></a>

Emiliano's empire would have been the envy of the much-fabled Corleones from the Godfather Trilogy.

But where the Corleones had been limited by their time, by technology, by the provincial scope of mid-century organized crime, Emiliano operated in an age where borders meant nothing and money moved at the speed of light. His empire wasn't just vast—it was omnipresent, reaching into every corner of American life with tentacles that wrapped around everything they touched.

Oxycodone, Xanax bars, Hennessey, Hashish, he ran it all.

The pharmaceutical supply chains were Emiliano's masterpiece. He had people in manufacturing facilities, in distribution warehouses, in hospital pharmacies. Legitimate prescriptions were diverted, truck shipments were intercepted, inventory records were altered. Oxycodone flowed out of Florida by the millions of pills, feeding the addiction epidemic that had already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The Xanax bars came in through Mexico, pressed in labs that looked legitimate enough to fool casual inspection. The Hennessey was real—imported through his shipping networks and sold at a markup that made the profit margins on drugs look modest by comparison. The hashish came from everywhere—Morocco, Lebanon, Afghanistan—moved through Richard's extremist contacts and delivered to American consumers who had no idea their purchases were funding operations halfway around the world.

But drugs were just the foundation.

Robotics, AI, space satellites, he had stakes in all of it.

The legitimate tech sector had opened up in ways that old-school organized crime could never have imagined. Emiliano invested early in startups that were developing automation systems, artificial intelligence platforms, satellite communication networks. He used shell companies and venture capital funds, laundering his drug money into respectable investments that paid dividends and gave him access to cutting-edge technology.

The AI companies were particularly useful. Their machine learning algorithms could predict law enforcement patterns, optimize distribution routes, identify potential threats before they materialized. The robotics firms were developing automated systems that could package and transport product without human intervention, reducing the risk of informants and witnesses. The satellite companies gave him communications capabilities that were nearly impossible to intercept or trace.

Emiliano had become what the Corleones could never have imagined—a criminal empire that owned pieces of the future itself.

Money flowed through his organization like blood through a body, and Emiliano spent it with the casual indifference of someone who knew there would always be more.

Emiliano threw out million dollar gifts to his harlot skanks like it was nothing.

He kept a rotating collection of women—models, actresses, Instagram influencers, college students who were attracted to wealth and danger in equal measure. They weren't girlfriends, weren't partners in the way Sigyn had been. They were decorations, toys, disposable pleasures that he could discard when they became boring or demanding or too aware of what he actually did.

He bought them cars, jewelry, apartments. Sent them on shopping sprees that cost more than most people made in a year. The money meant nothing to him—it was just numbers in accounts, easily replenished, infinite in its generation.

But sometimes Emiliano's sense of humor took a darker turn.

One time, Emiliano wrapped up a harlot in a big gift box and shipped the box to his affiliate, Richard Pham.

Her name was Madison or Morgan or something equally forgettable. She'd been asking too many questions, getting too curious about where the money came from, starting to become a liability. So Emiliano had drugged her champagne at dinner one night, waited for her to pass out, and then carefully packaged her in a custom-made crate with air holes and padding.

The shipping label read: "Fragile: Live Animal. Handle with Care."

He sent it through one of his freight companies, expedited international delivery to an address in Jakarta where Richard—or whatever he was calling himself now—operated.

The harlot was still alive upon arrival, but Richard Pham had been indoctrinated into an extremist organization at that point in time. Richard Pham had changed his name to Tensuramoto, and was in the process of helping terrorists move product through Asia.

The name change was symbolic—a rejection of the Vietnamese identity his parents had tried to force on him, an adoption of something that sounded vaguely Japanese but was probably made up. Tensuramoto had become someone else entirely, someone who moved through the shadows of Southeast Asia coordinating shipments of weapons and drugs, someone who'd decided that if the West had rejected him, he would burn the West down.

When the crate arrived, Tensuramoto opened it to find a confused, terrified woman who spoke no Indonesian and had no idea where she was or how she'd gotten there.

He'd looked at her for a long moment, this gift from his old friend, this joke that was also a test, this reminder of the bond they'd once shared and the different paths they'd taken.

Tensuramoto decapitated the harlot and sent her head back to Emiliano.

It arrived in a cooler packed with dry ice, delivered by a courier who had no idea what he was carrying. There was a note inside, written in neat handwriting:

"The rift between East and West cannot be bridged with whores. But I appreciate the gesture."

The rift between the East and West had deepened significantly since the Russia-Ukraine War and the United States's global trade war. Emiliano was Western, but Tensuramoto had turned back to his Eastern roots.

They maintained their business relationship—it was too profitable for both of them to let ideology get in the way—but the friendship had curdled into something else. Something colder. Transactional rather than personal.

Emiliano understood. In a way, he respected it. Tensuramoto had chosen his side, had committed fully to a vision of the world that put him in opposition to everything Emiliano represented. That took a certain kind of integrity, even if the integrity was in service of extremism and violence.

The head went into the bay that night, weighted down with chains, sent to join all the other bodies that had accumulated over the years.

Emiliano needed people he could actually trust, people who hadn't been radicalized or turned into something unrecognizable.

He relied on his friend back from high school, Joseph Clayton.

Joseph Clayton was a hopeless romantic during his middle school years, but upon reaching high school, Joseph Clayton made no hesitations to show all the girls there what an utter romantic he was.

Where Emiliano had been calculating and strategic in his conquests, Joseph had been genuinely romantic—writing poetry, bringing flowers, believing in love with an earnestness that should have been laughable but somehow worked. Girls had fallen for him in droves, drawn to his sincerity, his passion, his complete commitment to the romantic ideal.

Joseph Clayton had much sex with Maryann Clayton, Jessay Clayton, Mary Clayton, Lauren Clayton, Jordan Clayton, and Elana Clayton. All these women became Joseph Clayton's wives.

He'd converted to a fundamentalist Mormon sect in his early twenties, one of the splinter groups that still practiced plural marriage. It was perfect cover for his actual role in Emiliano's organization—the wives ran legitimate businesses that laundered money, the large family provided excuses for irregular schedules and frequent travel, and the religious community's insularity meant that law enforcement had difficulty penetrating their operations.

Joseph handled the real estate side of things—buying properties with cash, renting them to shell companies, using the rental income to justify the movement of drug money. The wives were smart, loyal, and completely devoted to Joseph, which meant they were loyal to Emiliano by extension.

"It's biblical," Joseph explained once, when Emiliano had asked how he managed six wives. "Solomon had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. I'm actually showing restraint."

Emiliano also employed the help of Joshua Polanski and Esteban Hernandez, complete homosexuals, the first openly gay couple at Emiliano's high school.

They were always making out with each other in the hallway then, back when being openly gay was still enough of a novelty to draw stares and whispers. They'd been brave in a way that Emiliano respected—refusing to hide, refusing to pretend, claiming space in a world that didn't want to give it to them.

Nowadays, they remained tight as nails. Married now, legally and legitimately, living in a tastefully decorated townhouse in Tampa's historic district.

Polanski and Hernandez trafficked drugs and whores for Emiliano.

They ran the clubs—the high-end establishments where Tampa's elite came to indulge their vices, where drugs flowed freely and beautiful women were always available for the right price. Polanski handled security and logistics, his background in computer science making him invaluable for surveillance systems and digital security. Hernandez managed the talent—recruiting the women, managing their schedules, ensuring they were kept happy enough to stay loyal and scared enough not to talk.

They were good at it. Ruthlessly efficient. The clubs generated millions in revenue while also serving as gathering places for information—drunk executives talked, and Polanski and Hernandez made sure everything was recorded, catalogued, ready to be used when leverage was needed.

It was great extra business for Emiliano, since the American economy had collapsed under the weight of the elites' excuses of A.I. lies.

The promised automation revolution had arrived, but instead of creating prosperity, it had created a permanent underclass of unemployed workers who couldn't compete with machines. The elites had claimed that AI would free humanity from drudgery, would create new opportunities, would usher in a golden age of leisure and creativity.

Instead, it had concentrated wealth even further, eliminated millions of jobs, and created a desperate population that turned to drugs and escapism because the future they'd been promised had been a lie.

Emiliano profited from every angle. The despair drove drug sales. The unemployment created a steady supply of people willing to work for his organization. The economic collapse meant that law enforcement was underfunded and overwhelmed, unable to effectively combat the sprawling criminal enterprise he'd built.

His tentacles reached everywhere now. Into the pharmaceutical companies and the tech startups. Into the legitimate businesses and the underground economy. Into the halls of power where politicians took his money and looked the other way. Into the police departments where officers supplemented their shrinking salaries by feeding him information.

Joseph Clayton and his six wives laundering money through real estate. Polanski and Hernandez running clubs where the elite came to forget their problems. Tensuramoto moving product through Asia, even as their friendship dissolved into mutual recognition that they'd chosen opposite sides of a civilizational conflict.

The Corleones had ruled New York for a generation, maybe two, before the law caught up with them, before their empire crumbled under its own contradictions.

But Emiliano was building something different. Something more durable. Something that didn't just exploit the weaknesses of society but had become woven into the fabric of how society functioned.

He sat in his penthouse office, looking at screens that showed real-time data from his operations—shipments moving through ports, money flowing through accounts, products being distributed across the country. The power in his blood hummed with satisfaction, with the recognition that this was what it had always been building toward.

Not love. Not revenge. Not even wealth or power for their own sake.

But the complete transformation of the world into something that bent around him, that existed to serve his will, that couldn't function without him at its center.

The menace of Emiliano's tentacles had spread so far, had gripped so tightly, that trying to remove them now would require tearing down the entire system they'd become integrated with.

And no one had the courage or the power to do that.

So the empire grew, the tentacles spread, and Emiliano Santiago Reyes—once a boy born with fire in his blood, now a man who'd turned that fire into an engine of transformation—prepared for whatever came next.

The real question wasn't whether his empire would fall.

It was whether there would be anything left of America when it finally did.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Emiliano Kills The DEA and FBI<a name="p7"></a>

The United States, at that point in time, had gone rampant and the officials were aggravating the conditions even further.

By the time Emiliano reached his mid-thirties, America had fractured in ways that would have been unimaginable a generation earlier. The federal government lurched from crisis to crisis, its legitimacy eroding with each scandal, each failure, each revelation of corruption that went unpunished. The DEA and FBI, once feared institutions that had brought down mob bosses and drug kingpins, were now shadows of their former selves—underfunded, demoralized, compromised by the very criminals they were supposed to be fighting.

The officials weren't just failing to stop the collapse. They were accelerating it. Every heavy-handed raid alienated communities. Every corrupt agent exposed destroyed public trust. Every bureaucratic failure created more space for people like Emiliano to operate.

It was a perfect storm of institutional decay, and Emiliano rode it like a surfer catching the wave of his life.

It was easy for Emiliano to kill almost all DEA and FBI agents that crossed his path.

Not personally, of course. Emiliano hadn't pulled a trigger in years. He didn't need to. He had people for that—professionals, specialists, true believers who saw federal agents as the enemy and were happy to eliminate them for the right price or the right cause.

But more importantly, he had information. The AI systems he'd invested in, the surveillance networks he'd built, the corrupt officials on his payroll—all of it combined to create a intelligence apparatus that rivaled what the government itself possessed. He knew where agents lived. Where they ate lunch. Where their children went to school. Where their weaknesses were.

Most agents, when they realized how exposed they were, backed off. Took reassignments. Retired early. Decided that their pension wasn't worth dying for.

But some were true believers. Some thought they were heroes. Some couldn't be bought or scared off.

DEA agents Jakob Keen and Stephen McNamara were annihilated by him.

Jakob Keen had been tracking Emiliano's pharmaceutical supply chain for three years. He was smart, dedicated, incorruptible—everything that made for a good agent and a dead man. He'd gotten close, too close, had started making connections that threatened to expose the entire network of doctors and pharmacists and distributors that kept the oxycodone flowing.

Emiliano had tried the gentle approach first. Had people reach out with offers of money, with threats against Keen's family, with promises that he could look the other way and no one would blame him.

Keen refused everything.

So Emiliano made a call, and three days later Jakob Keen's car exploded in his driveway. The investigation concluded it was a mechanical failure, a faulty fuel line. No one looked too closely. No one wanted to look too closely.

Stephen McNamara was FBI, assigned to a task force investigating Emiliano's ties to extremist organizations. He'd been building a RICO case, documenting connections, following money trails, getting close to indictments that could have brought down significant portions of the empire.

McNamara's death was more creative. Emiliano had people plant evidence that McNamara was actually working for a rival criminal organization, that he was corrupt, that his entire investigation was designed to eliminate Emiliano as competition. The evidence was convincing enough that McNamara's own agency turned on him. He was arrested, disgraced, and then—before he could defend himself or expose the frameup—he hung himself in his cell.

At least, that's what the official report said.

There were others. Dozens of others over the years. Agents who got too close, asked too many questions, refused to be bought or intimidated. They had accidents. They committed suicide. They were reassigned to Alaska and never heard from again. They retired suddenly and moved to remote locations where no one could find them.

The message was clear: investigate Emiliano Santiago Reyes at your own peril.

But even as he consolidated power domestically, Emiliano had to deal with complications abroad.

Emiliano also employed disaffected cartel members to kill Richard Pham (Tensuramoto), after hearing that he was working with extremist groups to stage a terrorist attack in China.

The intelligence came through multiple channels—intercepted communications, reports from contacts in Southeast Asia, warnings from Chinese business partners who'd gotten wind of something big being planned. Tensuramoto, his old friend who'd become something else entirely, was coordinating with Islamic extremist groups to launch an attack on Chinese infrastructure. Something big. Something that would kill thousands and destabilize the entire region.

Emiliano couldn't have someone like that linked to him. Emiliano had too many business contacts and factories in China.

The irony wasn't lost on him. He'd built an empire on violence and drugs, had killed federal agents and corrupted entire institutions, had destroyed countless lives in pursuit of power. But a terrorist attack in China? That crossed a line. Not a moral line—Emiliano had stopped pretending to care about morality years ago—but a practical one.

China was too important. The factories that manufactured his legitimate products. The financial networks that laundered his money. The political connections that gave him legitimacy on the world stage. A terrorist attack linked to someone in his orbit would destroy all of that, would bring down a level of scrutiny and retaliation that even his empire couldn't withstand.

So he made the call.

The disaffected cartel members were easy to find—men who'd been pushed aside by newer, younger sicarios, who resented Tensuramoto's arrogance and his extremist ideology, who were happy to eliminate him for the right price and the promise of better positions in Emiliano's organization.

They found Tensuramoto in Jakarta, in a safe house that wasn't as safe as he'd thought. The operation was quick, professional, brutal. No manifesto. No explanation. Just a body that was discovered three days later, decomposing in the tropical heat.

Emiliano felt nothing when he heard. His old friend from high school, the kid who'd been called a faggot and tried to join the CIA and ended up becoming a terrorist—he was gone now, erased, another casualty of the world they'd both helped create.

The terrorist attack never happened. The Chinese authorities never knew how close they'd come. Emiliano's business contacts in Beijing sent him expensive gifts and expressed their continued eagerness to work together.

The empire rolled on.

In the last decade of Emiliano's life, he looks back and sees his accomplishments for what they are.

He was fifty now, though he looked younger—good genes, better doctors, a life lived without the stress that destroyed ordinary men. He stood on the balcony of his penthouse in Tampa, the same penthouse he'd owned for twenty-five years, and looked out at a city that had transformed beyond recognition.

The Florida he'd been born into—the Florida of his parents, of sponge divers and fish houses and small immigrant communities struggling to survive—was gone. In its place was something else. Something new.

He had been part of a Hispanicization movement that had toppled the white supremacist establishment of America.

It hadn't been intentional, not at first. Emiliano had been focused on building his empire, on destroying his enemies, on accumulating power for its own sake. But in doing so, he'd been part of something larger—a demographic and cultural shift that had fundamentally altered the American power structure.

Multinational corporations headquartered in America had started to speak Spanish instead of English.

Not exclusively, of course. But Spanish had become the language of business in the same way English had once been. Board meetings were conducted in Spanish. Internal memos were written in Spanish. The assumption was that if you wanted to succeed in American business, you spoke Spanish fluently.

Corporate CEOs were virtually all Hispanic.

The Fortune 500 was dominated by names like Rodriguez and Garcia and Hernandez. The old Anglo establishment—the families that had run America for generations—had either adapted or been swept aside. Their children spoke Spanish, married into Hispanic families, tried desperately to maintain relevance in a world that no longer centered them.

The most renowned scientists in the country were now Hispanic.

The universities, the research institutions, the tech companies—all staffed primarily by Hispanic scientists and engineers who'd grown up in a world where they were told they could achieve anything, and who'd proven it to be true. The Nobel Prizes went to Hispanic researchers. The breakthrough technologies came from Hispanic entrepreneurs. The future was being built by people who looked like Emiliano's parents.

Chinese corporations had to bow down to people such as Emiliano.

The balance of power had shifted. China was still powerful, still growing, still a rival. But they needed access to American markets, American consumers, American networks of distribution. And those networks were controlled by people like Emiliano—Hispanic businessmen who straddled the line between legitimate and criminal, who could open doors or close them depending on how they were treated.

Chinese executives flew to Tampa to meet with Emiliano, to negotiate deals, to pay tribute in the form of favorable contracts and technology transfers. They called him "Mr. Reyes" and brought expensive gifts and treated him with the respect due to someone who held their fate in his hands.

Emiliano's side arms industry ran Vatican City.

The Catholic Church, desperate for protection in an increasingly unstable world, had turned to private security firms to guard its vast holdings. Emiliano owned the largest of these firms, which meant he controlled access to the Vatican, influenced who could and couldn't enter, had leverage over one of the world's oldest and most powerful institutions.

The Pope himself—a Hispanic man from Argentina—had met with Emiliano twice, blessing his "charitable work" while carefully not asking too many questions about where the money came from.

This was empire.

Not the kind that conquered territory or raised flags. Not the kind that history books traditionally celebrated. But empire nonetheless—a network of power and influence and control that spanned continents and shaped the lives of millions.

Emiliano was victorious, after all.

He'd started as nothing—a boy born in a fish house in Tarpon Springs, the son of immigrants, marked from birth by power he didn't understand. He'd been beaten, humiliated, told implicitly and explicitly that people like him would never matter, could never rise, should be grateful for whatever scraps the powerful chose to throw them.

And he'd taken that rage, that humiliation, that fire in his blood, and he'd used it to burn down the world that had tried to destroy him.

Not literally, of course. The world still turned. People still lived their lives. But the structure of power, the assumptions about who mattered and who didn't, the unquestioned supremacy of one group over another—all of that had been fundamentally altered.

And Emiliano had been the catalyst, the accelerant, the match that lit the fire.

He thought about Brittany Cluetrick sometimes, wondered what had become of her. Probably married to a lawyer or a banker, living in Connecticut, raising children who spoke Spanish because that's what you did now if you wanted them to succeed. She'd been his first lesson in power—how it was taken, how it was lost, how temporary it could be if you didn't know how to hold onto it.

He thought about Cameron Hasbeen, about the Anglo-Germanic bosses who'd beaten him bloody on that sidewalk. Most of them were dead now—overdoses, mostly, victims of the very drugs Emiliano had flooded their communities with. Poetic justice, if you believed in such things.

He thought about Sigyn, about Tensuramoto, about all the people he'd used and discarded and destroyed on his way to the top. He felt nothing for them. No guilt, no regret, no satisfaction. They were just names in a catalog of victories, proof that he'd been willing to do what others wouldn't.

The power in his blood—that strange heat that had pulsed from him since birth, that had guided him and shaped him and made him into something more than human—it sang quietly now. Contentedly. Like a beast that had been fed and was sleeping peacefully.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes, at fifty years old, stood at the pinnacle of an empire that would have been inconceivable to the boy he'd once been.

He'd killed federal agents. He'd destroyed institutions. He'd corrupted governments and infiltrated corporations and reshaped the very fabric of American society.

And when he looked back at his life, at everything he'd accomplished, at the world he'd helped create, he felt no doubt, no uncertainty, no questioning of whether it had been worth it.

Of course it had been worth it.

Because he'd won.

And in the end, Emiliano had learned, winning was the only thing that mattered.

The sun set over Tampa Bay, painting the sky in shades of orange and red and gold. Ships moved through the water, carrying cargo that Emiliano owned or controlled or had interest in. The city lights began to glow as darkness fell, and somewhere in that city, in all the cities across America, people were using his products, working in his businesses, living in the world he'd helped shape.

Such utter romantics of Florida, they'd been. He and all the others who'd believed in something more, who'd refused to accept the limits the world tried to impose, who'd had the audacity to dream of empire in an age that claimed empire was impossible.

Of fiction and fantasia, perhaps. But fiction had become reality, and fantasia had been made manifest.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, standing on his balcony as night fell over Florida, knew that his story—his impossible, violent, triumphant story—would echo long after he was gone.

The boy born with fire in his blood had set the world ablaze.

And from those ashes, something new had risen.

His victory was complete.

## The Supreme Leader Emiliano's Funeral<a name="p8"></a>

So many accolades, Nobel Prizes, at the funeral.

They lined the walls of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, encased in glass and lit by spotlights that made them glow like holy relics. The Nobel Prize in Economics, awarded for his "revolutionary contributions to global trade theory." The Nobel Peace Prize, given for his "instrumental role in mediating conflicts between Eastern and Western powers." Three separate Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Medicine, technically awarded to research institutions he'd funded, but everyone knew who'd made the breakthroughs possible.

There were others too—the Presidential Medal of Freedom, honorary doctorates from Harvard and Oxford and Beijing University, humanitarian awards from organizations that bore his name, commendations from governments across the globe. They covered the cathedral walls like the stations of the cross, marking the milestones of a life that had transcended anything that could be measured by ordinary standards.

Oxycodone, xanax bars, mollies. An extravagant funeral for a great man.

The distribution was handled discreetly, of course. Attendants in somber black suits moved through the crowd with silver trays, offering pills alongside champagne and canapés. It was tradition now—Emiliano's traditions, the ones he'd established over decades of reshaping society to his specifications. No one batted an eye. Heads of state popped xanax bars before their eulogies to calm their nerves. CEOs dropped mollies and embraced each other, crying about the loss of their greatest patron. The elderly took their oxycodone openly, pain management that doubled as tribute.

The cathedral itself was a masterpiece of excess. Every surface dripped with flowers—orchids from Colombia, roses from Ecuador, lilies from Mexico. The air was thick with their perfume, almost narcotic in its intensity. Screens mounted between the stained glass windows showed footage from Emiliano's life—the official version, carefully curated, showing the philanthropist, the businessman, the visionary who'd transformed America and the world.

The casket was solid platinum, custom-made, weighing over a thousand pounds. It sat on a raised dais at the front of the cathedral, surrounded by candles and flowers and honor guards in dress uniforms from a dozen different countries. Inside, Emiliano lay in his finest suit, his hands folded over his chest, his face peaceful in death in a way it had never been in life.

The year was 2080. Emiliano, the man that bested the Corleones a million times over, and much more influential than any megalomaniacal American president in history.

He had lived to be ninety-five, though the official records said ninety-two—a small vanity, even at the end. His mind had stayed sharp until the very end, his empire functioning flawlessly even as his body slowly failed him. He'd died in his sleep in the penthouse in Tampa, the same penthouse he'd owned for seventy years, looking out over a city and a world that bore his fingerprints on every surface.

The Corleones, those mythical gangsters from a different age, had controlled New York for perhaps two generations. They'd been powerful, certainly. Legendary, even. But their empire had crumbled, their family had scattered, and within a few decades they'd been reduced to footnotes in history books and characters in movies.

Emiliano had built something that lasted. Something that had become woven into the fabric of civilization itself. You couldn't remove his influence without unraveling everything. The drug trade, the legitimate corporations, the political networks, the cultural transformation—it was all his legacy, all bearing his mark, all continuing long after his death.

Presidents had come and gone. Some had tried to challenge him, to reassert federal authority, to restore some mythical version of American greatness that had never actually existed. They'd all failed. Some had been destroyed by scandals that Emiliano orchestrated. Others had simply been outmaneuvered, rendered irrelevant by forces they couldn't understand or control.

No American president—not Washington, not Lincoln, not Roosevelt—had shaped the nation as profoundly as Emiliano Santiago Reyes. And he'd done it without ever holding elected office, without ever claiming formal power, without ever pretending to be anything other than what he was.

The funeral stretched over three days. It was part memorial, part celebration, part political convention. Everyone who mattered in the world was there, paying their respects to the man who'd held their fates in his hands.

On the first day, the politicians came. The President of the United States—a Hispanic woman from Texas who'd built her career with Emiliano's backing—delivered a eulogy that brought the crowd to tears. She spoke of his generosity, his vision, his unwavering commitment to the Hispanic community. She didn't mention the drugs, the murders, the corruption. Everyone knew, but no one spoke of it. That was the agreement, the fiction that allowed society to function.

The Chinese Premier sent a video message, praising Emiliano's role in facilitating trade between East and West. The Pope—the third Hispanic Pope in a row, a tradition that Emiliano had helped establish—led a special mass and called him "a son of the Church who never forgot his faith."

On the second day, the business community took center stage. CEOs from every major corporation gave testimonials about Emiliano's business acumen, his innovative thinking, his ability to see opportunities that others missed. They talked about the factories he'd built, the jobs he'd created, the technologies he'd funded. The irony that many of them had started their careers working in his drug distribution networks went unmentioned.

Joseph Clayton was there, now in his seventies, his six wives standing behind him in matching black dresses. He spoke about loyalty and friendship and the importance of family—biological and chosen. He didn't mention the money laundering or the real estate schemes or the countless crimes they'd committed together. Just warm memories of a lifelong friendship.

Joshua Polanski and Esteban Hernandez, both in their eighties, stood together at the podium and spoke about how Emiliano had supported them when no one else would, how he'd given them opportunities, how he'd never judged them for who they loved. The clubs they'd run, the women they'd trafficked, the lives destroyed—all of it was glossed over in favor of a narrative about acceptance and brotherhood.

On the third day, the masses came. Thousands of people who'd worked for Emiliano's companies, who'd benefited from his charitable foundations, who'd used his products and lived in his buildings and existed within the systems he'd created. They filed past the platinum casket, crossing themselves, leaving flowers, weeping for a man most of them had never met but whose influence had touched every aspect of their lives.

The cathedral could only hold a few thousand at a time, so the viewing continued around the clock. Outside, vendors sold food and drinks and memorabilia—t-shirts with Emiliano's face, commemorative coins, even small vials of pills marked "In Loving Memory." It was carnival and funeral combined, grief and celebration inseparable.

The speeches were endless. Scientists talked about the research he'd funded. Artists discussed the galleries and museums that bore his name. Educators praised the schools and universities he'd built. Everyone had a story about Emiliano's generosity, his vision, his impact on their lives.

No one mentioned Cameron Hasbeen, who'd died of an overdose at nineteen. No one talked about Brittany Cluetrick, who'd achieved everything she'd wanted in life but whose name was now a footnote in Emiliano's mythology. No one spoke of Tylerios Remancos, who'd jumped from a balcony after being humiliated. No one remembered the DEA agents, the FBI investigators, the rival criminals, the women who'd been used and discarded.

History was written by the victors, and Emiliano had won so completely that there were no competing narratives left to challenge his version of events.

On the evening of the third day, as the sun set over St. Augustine, they sealed the platinum casket and began the procession to the mausoleum. It had been built specifically for Emiliano—a massive structure on the grounds of the cathedral, designed to resemble a temple, funded by donations from his corporate empire.

The procession stretched for miles. Military honor guards from a dozen countries. Motorcycle escorts from police departments he'd owned. Mourners by the hundreds of thousands, lining the streets, holding candles, singing hymns in Spanish and English and Chinese and Arabic.

Inside the mausoleum, they placed the casket in a tomb of marble and gold. Above it, carved in letters three feet tall, were the words:

EMILIANO SANTIAGO REYES
1985-2080
VISIONARY, PHILANTHROPIST, LIBERATOR
"HIS POWER MADE HISTORY"

Below that, smaller but still prominent:

"SUCH UTTER ROMANTICS OF FLORIDA:
OF FICTION AND FANTASIA"

The tomb was sealed with ceremony and prayer and more drugs—offerings to speed his journey to whatever came next, though no one really believed Emiliano needed help getting anywhere he wanted to go.

The mourners filed out slowly, reluctantly, as if leaving meant accepting that the era of Emiliano was truly over. Outside, the celebration continued. Music played, people danced, drugs flowed freely. It was grief and joy intertwined, mourning and gratitude, the end of an age and the continuation of everything he'd built.

Because that was Emiliano's final victory—he'd made himself irreplaceable while simultaneously ensuring that his empire would continue without him. The systems he'd created were self-sustaining now. The culture he'd shaped had become the new normal. The power structure he'd established would persist for generations.

His children—legitimate and otherwise—held positions throughout the empire. His grandchildren were being groomed to take over. His great-grandchildren would inherit a world that Emiliano had fundamentally transformed.

In Tampa, in his old penthouse that had been converted into a museum, visitors would soon come to see his possessions, to walk through the rooms where he'd planned his conquests, to stand on the balcony where he'd surveyed his domain. They'd learn about the boy born in a fish house who'd grown up to reshape America. They'd hear about the passion and the vision and the unstoppable drive.

They wouldn't hear about the violence, the corruption, the countless destroyed lives. Or if they did hear about it, it would be presented as unfortunate but necessary, the price that had to be paid for progress, the dark side of genius that made the bright side possible.

In the mausoleum, in his platinum tomb, Emiliano lay still and silent for the first time in ninety-five years. The power that had pulsed in his blood since birth, that strange heat that had marked him as different from the moment he was born, had finally gone quiet.

But its effects would echo for centuries.

The Hispanicization of America was complete and irreversible. The old Anglo power structure had been dismantled and would never return. The drug trade had been normalized, integrated into society so thoroughly that trying to eliminate it would require destroying modern civilization itself. The corruption had become so systematic that it was simply how things worked now.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes had won not just for himself, but for everyone who came after him. He'd proven that power wasn't about birthright or skin color or old family names. It was about will, about vision, about the willingness to do whatever was necessary to achieve victory.

As the last mourners left the mausoleum and the doors were sealed, as the guards took their positions and the candles burned low, as the world slowly accepted that Emiliano was truly gone, one truth remained undeniable:

He had been born with fire in his blood, and he had set the world ablaze.

And when the flames finally died down, everything had been transformed—society, culture, power itself—into something that bore his image, his will, his inescapable influence.

The funeral was over.

The legend had just begun.

And somewhere in Florida—in the heat and the humidity, in the space between land and sea, in that liminal place where reality had always been thinner than elsewhere—the power that had made Emiliano what he was continued to hum, waiting for the next person who would be born with fire in their blood, waiting to wake again, waiting to remake the world one more time.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these people born in that strange peninsula where anything seemed possible and often was.

Of fiction and fantasia, they lived and died and left behind legacies that defied logic and reason.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, lying in his platinum tomb beneath tons of marble and gold, had proven once and for all that the most impossible stories were the ones that actually came true.

His power had never made history if he had not been brought into this world.

But he had been.

And everything—everything—had changed because of it.

The End.
