## The Birth of Emiliano<a name="p1"></a>

"Emiliano's power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world."

The midwife's hands trembled as she caught the infant, not from inexperience—she had delivered hundreds of babies along the mangrove-tangled coast of Florida—but from the strange heat radiating from the child's skin. It was August, the air thick as wet wool, yet this warmth was different. It pulsed.

"Dios mío," she whispered, crossing herself with slick fingers.

Maria Consuela Reyes had labored for fourteen hours in the back room of her father's fish house in Tarpon Springs. The smell of salt and mullet hung in the air, mixing with her sweat and the iron scent of birth. Outside, the Gulf of Mexico whispered against the docks, and pelicans called to one another in the dying light.

When Emiliano finally emerged into the world, he did not cry. His eyes—dark as the water at midnight—opened immediately, fixing on his mother's face with an intensity that made her catch her breath. In that moment, Maria felt something pass between them, a current of recognition that transcended the ordinary bond between mother and child.

"Is he well?" she gasped, reaching for him.

The midwife hesitated, then placed the boy on Maria's chest. "He is... perfect," she said, though her voice carried a note of uncertainty. "More than perfect."

Maria's husband, Santiago, stood in the doorway, his sponge-diver's shoulders filling the frame. He had been born in Greece, had come to Florida chasing the same underwater fortune as thousands of others, and had learned to read the sea's moods the way other men read newspapers. Now, looking at his newborn son, he felt that same instinctive knowledge stirring in his gut—the sense that something profound had shifted in the world.

"What will you call him?" the midwife asked, washing her hands in a basin of water that steamed despite the August heat.

"Emiliano," Maria said without hesitation. The name had come to her in dreams during her pregnancy, whispered by voices she could not quite hear, in a language she did not quite understand. "Emiliano Santiago Reyes."

The baby's tiny hand opened and closed, as if grasping at invisible threads in the air. Later, the midwife would tell her sister that she had seen something flickering around those small fingers—a shimmer like heat rising from sun-baked sand, or the aurora of St. Elmo's fire that sometimes danced on the masts of ships before a storm. But in the moment, she said nothing. Some things were better left unspoken.

That night, while Maria slept with Emiliano curled against her side, Santiago walked down to the docks. The moon was full, painting a silver road across the black water. He lit a cigarette and watched the smoke curl into the darkness, thinking about his son, about the strange sensation he had felt in that birthing room—as if the air itself had been holding its breath.

A pelican landed on a nearby piling, its prehistoric profile sharp against the stars. It regarded Santiago with one ancient eye, and for a moment, the sponge diver had the absurd feeling that the bird knew something he did not.

"You felt it too," he said aloud, surprising himself.

The pelican said nothing, of course. But it did not fly away either. It simply watched, as if waiting for something inevitable to begin.

In the fish house, Emiliano dreamed. Though newborns are not supposed to dream in the way that children and adults do, this one did. He dreamed of fire and water, of light bending through crystal, of patterns hidden in chaos. He dreamed of a power sleeping in his blood, ancient and patient, waiting for the day when he would be old enough to understand what he had been born to do.

Florida had seen many strange births in its long, wild history. The land itself had been born from limestone and time, sculpted by water and wind into something neither quite solid nor quite liquid. It was a place of in-betweens, of boundaries where one thing became another. Freshwater met salt. Land dissolved into sea. Reality grew thin in the subtropical heat, and sometimes—just sometimes—the impossible leaked through.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes was born in that liminal space, in that hour when day surrenders to night, in that place where the continent gives way to the ocean. And from the moment he drew his first breath, the world began to bend around him, waiting to see what shape his power would take.

The midwife burned sage in her home that night, though she could not have said exactly why. She simply knew, in the way that certain people know things, that she had witnessed the beginning of something that would echo far beyond the small fishing town of Tarpon Springs, far beyond the mangrove coast of Florida, far beyond any distance that could be measured in miles.

History, after all, is not made by the passage of time alone. It is made by the people who step into its current and change its course. And Emiliano, barely hours old, sleeping peacefully in his mother's arms, had already begun to stir those waters.

His power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world.

But he was.

And everything that followed—every miracle, every catastrophe, every impossible moment—began in that small room above the fish house, on that August night, when a child with fire in his blood opened his eyes and looked upon Florida for the first time.

## Emiliano's First Love<a name="p2"></a>

Emiliano's first girlfriend was Brittany Cluetrick. It was as easy for Emiliano to have sex with Cluetrick as it was for him to fist her. He was suave and outgoing, and gentle until he was not. Polite, intelligent, and was Cluetrick's top pick for ethnic boyfriend.

They met in AP Literature during junior year at Clearwater High School. Emiliano had grown into his features by then—the dark eyes that had unsettled the midwife now drew admiring glances, and the heat that had pulsed from his infant skin had transformed into a different kind of magnetism. He wore it like a second skin, this charm, this ability to make people lean closer when he spoke.

Brittany Cluetrick sat two rows ahead of him, her blonde hair always pulled into a perfect ponytail that swung when she turned to look at him. She was captain of the debate team, president of the Honor Society, and possessed the kind of confidence that came from never having been told no. Her family had money—old Florida money, the kind that came from phosphate mines and cattle ranches, before the state became a destination for snowbirds and theme parks.

"You're Emiliano, right?" she said after class one October afternoon, her blue eyes appraising him with an openness that might have been flattering or predatory, depending on how you looked at it. "You write really well. Your essay on Gatsby was actually interesting."

"Thanks," he said, slinging his backpack over one shoulder. "You're Brittany."

"I am." She smiled, showing perfectly straight teeth. "We should study together sometime. For the midterm."

They both knew she didn't need help studying. Brittany Cluetrick had never scored below a 95 on anything in her life. But Emiliano understood the game being played, had understood it instinctively from the moment she'd approached him.

"Sure," he said. "When?"

That Friday, they met at her house—a sprawling ranch-style home in a gated community where the lawns were maintained by landscaping crews and the driveways held German cars. Her parents were in Tampa for the weekend, attending some charity gala. They had the house to themselves.

They studied for maybe twenty minutes, textbooks open on the kitchen island, before Brittany closed her copy of The Great Gatsby and looked at him directly.

"You know," she said, "I've never dated anyone like you before."

"Like me?"

"You know. Ethnic." She said it casually, as if commenting on the weather, as if the word didn't carry the weight of every assumption she'd ever made about people who didn't look like her family photos. "My parents would have a fit."

Emiliano set down his pen. He could have been offended. Should have been, maybe. But he'd learned early that offense was a luxury for people who didn't understand how power worked. Instead, he smiled.

"That's part of the appeal, isn't it?" he said. "The fact that they'd have a fit."

Brittany's smile widened. "Maybe."

What followed was inevitable in the way that certain chemical reactions are inevitable once you combine the right elements. They came together with an intensity that surprised both of them, though for different reasons. For Brittany, it was the thrill of transgression, of claiming something her parents' world had taught her to admire from a distance but never touch. For Emiliano, it was something else—a testing of boundaries, an exploration of the power he'd always felt coiled inside him but never quite understood.

He was gentle with her at first, polite in the way his mother had taught him to be with all people, regardless of whether they deserved it. But Brittany didn't want gentle. She wanted to be consumed, to feel something that contradicted every safe, sanitized experience her privileged life had offered her.

"Don't treat me like I'm breakable," she whispered against his mouth, her nails digging into his shoulders.

So he didn't.

Their relationship became a pattern of escalation. Each encounter pushed further than the last, testing limits that Brittany had never known she had. Emiliano discovered that he possessed an intuitive understanding of what she wanted before she could articulate it—the same way his father could read the sea, he could read the currents of desire and submission that flowed beneath the surface of every interaction.

It was as easy for him to have sex with her as it was to take her apart completely, to reduce her to nothing but sensation and surrender. She craved it, this dissolution of the self-control she maintained everywhere else in her life. With him, she could be something other than Brittany Cluetrick, Honor Society president and future Yale student. She could be raw and unfinished and desperate.

At school, they maintained a careful distance. Brittany had her reputation to consider, after all. But in private—in her empty house, in his car parked by the beach at midnight, in the borrowed apartment of a friend who asked no questions—they were something else entirely. Something that couldn't be easily categorized or explained.

"I like that you're not like the other guys," she told him once, lying tangled in her sheets while her parents attended another weekend function. "You're smart. You actually read. You're not just some..."

She trailed off, but Emiliano heard the end of the sentence anyway. Not just some stereotype. Not just some fantasy. Not just some exotic diversion.

Except that's exactly what he was to her, and they both knew it.

He didn't mind, not really. Because she was something to him too—a door into a world that had always existed adjacent to his own but never quite intersected with it. Through Brittany, he learned how the other half lived, how they spoke about people like his family when they thought no one was listening, how they collected experiences and relationships the way his mother collected seashells on the beach.

Their relationship lasted seven months, which was longer than anyone expected but shorter than Brittany had probably hoped. It ended not with drama but with inevitability, the way tides turn not because of any single wave but because the moon pulls them in a different direction.

"I'm going to Yale in the fall," she said in May, as if this were news, as if they hadn't both known from the beginning that this had an expiration date.

"I know," Emiliano said.

"And you're... what, staying here? Going to community college?"

"University of Florida," he corrected. "Full scholarship."

"Oh. That's good." She said it in a tone that suggested it wasn't good enough, that nothing in Florida could ever be good enough for someone who'd been accepted to the Ivy League.

They had sex one last time, in her bedroom with the windows open and the smell of jasmine drifting in from the garden her mother's landscapers maintained. It was different than usual—less intense, more perfunctory, as if they were both going through motions they'd memorized but no longer felt.

Afterward, Brittany lay with her head on his chest and said, "I'll remember you, you know. When I'm up there."

Emiliano stared at the ceiling fan turning lazy circles overhead. "Will you?"

"Yeah. You were... important. To me. You were my first... a lot of things."

He didn't ask what things. He already knew. First ethnic boyfriend. First walk on the wild side. First rebellion against parental expectations. First experience of losing control. First of many stories she'd tell at college parties, edited and softened until he became a character rather than a person.

"You were important to me too," he said, because it was true, even if the importance was different than she imagined.

They didn't stay in touch. Brittany went to Yale and joined a sorority and dated a lacrosse player named Chip or Chad or something equally predictable. Emiliano saw her Instagram posts occasionally—perfectly curated photos of ivy-covered buildings and autumn leaves and friends who all looked like variations of her.

But sometimes, late at night when he was alone, he thought about what he'd learned from Brittany Cluetrick. Not just about sex or desire or the performance of intimacy, but about power. About how easily people gave it away when you understood what they wanted, what they needed, what they'd never admit to needing.

He'd been gentle with her until he wasn't. Polite until politeness became another form of cruelty. Intelligent enough to see exactly what she was offering and smart enough to take it without attachment.

Brittany had chosen him as her top pick for ethnic boyfriend, collecting him like a trophy, a story, a temporary deviation from the path her life was always meant to follow.

But in the process, she'd taught him something valuable about the nature of power and desire, about the way people could be taken apart and reassembled, about the difference between what people said they wanted and what they actually craved.

It was a lesson he would carry with him long after her name became just another entry in the catalog of his past, long after her face blurred into the general category of "girls from high school," long after everything else that would follow in the strange and impossible story of Emiliano Santiago Reyes.

His first love had been a transaction, an education, a prelude.

And like everything else in his life, it had been touched by that power sleeping in his blood, waiting to wake fully, waiting to show him what he was truly capable of becoming.

## Emiliano Has His First Break-Up<a name="p3"></a>

Despite Emiliano's seductive and suave nature, Emiliano could not have held onto Brittany Cluetrick. Brittany Cluetrick was too Germanic-Slavic to exude the same kind of warm, romantic compassion as Emiliano. She had other pursuers. Those pursuers had group sex with her.

The truth came out on a Tuesday in April, during lunch period. Emiliano was sitting in the courtyard with his physics textbook open, not really reading it, just enjoying the way the spring sun felt on his face. The power in his blood hummed quietly, contentedly, the way it always did when he was at peace.

Then Cameron Hasbeen sat down across from him.

Cameron Hasbeen was great once upon a time, but now he was just a has been. He'd been quarterback freshman year, before he blew out his knee. He'd been dating the prettiest girl in school, before she left him for a senior. He'd been headed for a football scholarship, before the injury reports killed that dream. Now he was just another face in the hallway, clinging to former glory like a drowning man clinging to driftwood.

"Yo, Emiliano," Cameron said, his smile too wide, too eager. "Got a minute?"

Emiliano looked up from his textbook. Something in Cameron's eyes—a glittering malice, a desperate hunger for relevance—made his skin prickle.

"What's up, Cameron?"

"Just wanted to talk to you. Man to man." Cameron leaned back, spreading his arms along the top of the bench like he owned it. "About Brittany."

The humming in Emiliano's blood went quiet.

"What about her?"

"I mean, you guys are still together, right?" Cameron's smile didn't waver. "Still doing your thing?"

"Yeah."

"That's cool, that's cool." Cameron nodded like he was considering something profound. "She's a wild one, isn't she? I mean, you'd know. You've been there."

Emiliano closed his textbook slowly. "Where are you going with this, Cameron?"

"Nowhere, man. Just making conversation." Cameron paused, savoring the moment like a fine wine. "Did she ever tell you about last weekend? About the party at Derek Whitmore's place?"

"No."

"Huh. That's weird. I figured she would've mentioned it." Cameron leaned forward now, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "There were like six of us there. Me, Derek, Brad, Tyler, Jake, Connor. We were all just hanging out, you know? And Brittany shows up, already pretty drunk. And one thing leads to another, and..."

He trailed off, watching Emiliano's face for a reaction.

"And what?" Emiliano's voice was flat, controlled.

"Come on, man. You know what. She was all over us. All of us. At the same time." Cameron grinned. "Your girl's got some stamina, I'll give her that. But here's the thing—" He leaned even closer now, his breath smelling like energy drinks and cigarettes. "I had anal sex with Brittany Cluetrick. And it was fucking incredible."

The courtyard seemed to tilt. Emiliano could hear his heartbeat in his ears, could feel that power in his blood starting to wake up, starting to pulse in a rhythm that wasn't quite human.

"You're lying."

"Am I?" Cameron pulled out his phone, swiped through it, turned the screen toward Emiliano. "Got the pictures to prove it, bro. Well, not of that specifically—she made us put the phones away for the actual fucking—but here she is at the party. And here's the group chat where we all talked about it after."

Emiliano looked at the screen. Saw Brittany in the photos, her eyes glassy, her smile sloppy, surrounded by guys he vaguely recognized from the lacrosse team and the wrestling team. Saw the messages in the group chat, crude and celebratory, dissecting her body like she was a piece of meat they'd all shared.

"Why are you telling me this?" Emiliano asked quietly.

Cameron shrugged. "Just thought you should know what your girlfriend's really like. Thought you deserved the truth." He stood up, pocketing his phone. "No hard feelings, right? I mean, she was the one who wanted it. All of it. We just gave the lady what she asked for."

Emiliano didn't move. Couldn't move. The power in his blood was roaring now, demanding release, demanding that he do something, anything, to make this right, to make Cameron pay for the smile on his face, for the satisfaction in his voice.

But he didn't. He just sat there, frozen, while Cameron walked away.

Emiliano was livid and walked away. He left his textbook on the bench, left his backpack in his locker, left school entirely. He walked to the beach and sat on the sand and stared at the Gulf of Mexico while the power in his blood screamed at him to go back, to find Cameron, to unleash whatever it was that lived inside him and burn everything down.

But he didn't.

He called Brittany instead.

"It's over," he said when she answered.

"What? Why?"

"You know why."

There was a pause. Then: "Cameron told you."

"Yeah."

"Emiliano, it wasn't—it didn't mean anything. I was drunk, and they were all there, and—"

"It's over," he repeated, and hung up.

He sat on the beach until the sun went down, until the power in his blood quieted to a dull roar, until he felt human enough to go home.

But Cameron Hasbeen wasn't done.

Cameron Hasbeen, out of his insecurity, phoned his Anglo-Germanic bosses to try to destroy Emiliano. The bosses were older guys, graduates from a few years back who still hung around the school parking lot on weekends, selling pills and weed and nostalgia to kids who mistook their presence for coolness. They had names like Gunnar and Sven and Klaus, and they drove lifted trucks with Confederate flags on the bumpers, and they didn't like that some Latino kid had made one of them feel small.

They found Emiliano three days later, walking home from the library.

It was dusk, that in-between hour when Florida light turns gold and soft. Emiliano was thinking about nothing in particular, his headphones in, his mind drifting, when the truck pulled up beside him.

He didn't see it coming.

Four of them jumped out—big guys, ex-football players and amateur gym rats with arms like tree trunks and fists like hammers. They didn't say anything. Didn't give him a chance to run or fight or use whatever power lived in his blood.

They just started hitting him.

Emiliano went down hard, his head bouncing off the pavement. He tried to curl up, tried to protect his face and ribs, but there were too many of them. Boots and fists rained down on him, and through the pain he could hear them laughing, could hear Cameron's voice somewhere nearby, egging them on.

"That's what you get, you fucking spic. That's what you get for thinking you're better than us."

The power in his blood tried to respond, tried to surge up and defend him, but Emiliano was already losing consciousness, already slipping away into darkness where even that ancient heat couldn't follow.

They left him there on the sidewalk, bleeding and broken.

A neighbor found him twenty minutes later and called 911.

Emiliano was sent to the hospital after that incident. He woke up in a white room that smelled like antiseptic and despair, his mother's tear-stained face hovering over him, his father's hand gripping his with a strength that spoke of rage and helplessness in equal measure.

"Who did this to you?" his father asked, his voice shaking.

"Doesn't matter," Emiliano said through split lips.

"It matters," Maria insisted. "We'll call the police. We'll—"

"It doesn't matter," Emiliano repeated.

And it didn't, not really. Because he understood now what Brittany had represented, what Cameron's betrayal had revealed. He'd been playing a game whose rules were set by people who would never let him win, who would always find a way to put him back in his place when he got too comfortable, too confident, too close to believing he was one of them.

Brittany had never been his. She'd been theirs—their experiment, their walk on the wild side, their temporary rebellion. And when she was done with him, they'd made sure he understood exactly where he stood in the hierarchy.

He spent three days in the hospital with a concussion, two cracked ribs, and a fractured cheekbone. The police took a statement, but Emiliano couldn't identify his attackers in the dark, couldn't prove Cameron had orchestrated it, couldn't make the system care about what happened to a kid from Tarpon Springs who'd gotten jumped in a nice neighborhood.

When he got home, he found that Brittany had blocked him on all social media. Cameron had transferred to a private school across town. The Anglo-Germanic bosses had vanished, as people like them always did when consequences threatened to catch up with them.

Emiliano lay in his bed and felt the power in his blood pulse quietly, patiently, as if it had been waiting for exactly this moment. As if it knew that this was what it took—pain and humiliation and betrayal—to wake it up fully, to transform it from a sleeping potential into something active and dangerous.

He thought about Brittany, about the way she'd looked at him that first day in AP Literature, about the way she'd taken him apart and put him back together according to her specifications. He thought about Cameron's smile, about the satisfaction in his voice when he described what he'd done. He thought about the boots and fists, about the pavement against his skull, about the laughter.

And he understood, finally, what his mother had sensed the night he was born, what the midwife had seen flickering around his infant fingers, what his father had felt standing on the dock beneath a full moon.

He was not like them. Would never be like them. Could never be like them.

But that didn't mean he was powerless.

His first break-up had taught him about loss, about the nature of desire and betrayal, about the cruelty that lived in people who smiled while they destroyed you.

But it had also taught him something else.

It had taught him that the power in his blood was real, was waiting, was ready.

And sooner or later, everyone who had underestimated Emiliano Santiago Reyes would learn exactly what that meant.

The Germanic-Slavic coldness that Brittany Cluetrick had carried in her bones could never have matched the fire that burned in his. The insecurity that drove Cameron Hasbeen to betray him would seem like nothing compared to what was coming.

Because Emiliano's first break-up wasn't just an ending.

It was a beginning.

And the world—Florida, America, reality itself—would eventually bend around what he was about to become.

# Ameliorating Emiliano<a name="p4"></a>

Emiliano had this power to him after the event. Emiliano, the passionate and fiery Romantic he was, had no difficulties converting his love into hate.

The transformation happened in the hospital bed, somewhere between the morphine drip and the sound of his mother's prayers. The power that had always hummed beneath his skin—dormant, patient, waiting—finally woke up completely. It stretched and yawned and opened its eyes, and when Emiliano looked at the world through those new eyes, everything appeared different.

Clearer. Sharper. Full of possibility.

Love and hate, he realized, were not opposites. They were the same energy flowing in different directions. And he had always been good at channeling energy. The warmth he'd shown Brittany, the gentleness he'd offered before she'd asked him to stop being gentle—all of that could be inverted, transformed, weaponized.

Emiliano started to form a darkness within him that he intended to unleash onto the world, impregnating it with all his power for a world in his image.

It started as a whisper in his mind during those long nights of recovery, when the painkillers wore off and the power in his blood pulsed in time with his heartbeat. He would not simply survive what had been done to him. He would not simply move on, forgive, forget, become another cautionary tale about knowing your place.

No.

He would become something else entirely. Something that people like Cameron Hasbeen and Brittany Cluetrick and their Anglo-Germanic bosses could not comprehend until it was too late. He would build an empire from the ashes of his humiliation, and everyone who had laughed while he bled on the pavement would eventually kneel before what he became.

The world thought it knew what power looked like. It thought power was money and whiteness and old family names and the ability to destroy someone without consequences.

Emiliano would teach the world differently.

In order to do so, Emiliano started by snatching up one of Tylerios Remancos's girlfriends, Sigyn Thornprikkenson.

Tylerios Remancos was a name that carried weight in certain circles—the son of a shipping magnate, connected to the Nordic networks that controlled much of the international trade flowing through Florida's ports. He was twenty-three, handsome in that cold, chiseled way that came from good genes and better gym memberships, and he collected beautiful women the way other men collected sports cars.

Sigyn Thornprikkenson was his favorite acquisition. She was Norwegian, tall and blonde and devastating, with eyes like a winter sky and a laugh that could make men do stupid things. Tylerios kept her in a penthouse overlooking Clearwater Beach and showed her off at parties like a prize he'd won.

Emiliano met her at one of those parties, six weeks after he was released from the hospital. He'd been invited by a dealer he'd befriended, someone who didn't know or care about his high school drama, who only saw potential in the intensity that now radiated from Emiliano like heat from asphalt in August.

Sigyn was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigarette and looking bored. Emiliano approached her with the confidence of someone who had nothing left to lose.

"You look like you'd rather be anywhere else," he said.

She glanced at him, taking in his still-healing face, the fading bruises that makeup couldn't quite cover. "Perceptive."

"I'm Emiliano."

"Sigyn." She offered her hand. He took it, held it a moment longer than necessary, felt something pass between them—recognition, attraction, the chemical reaction of two people who understood that rules were for other people.

"Want to get out of here?" he asked.

She smiled. "Tylerios will be furious."

"Good."

Within fifteen minutes of meeting her, he had already had anal sex with her. They didn't even leave the building—just found an empty bedroom three floors down, locked the door, and came together with an urgency that had nothing to do with romance and everything to do with rebellion and rage and the particular pleasure that comes from taking something that belongs to someone else.

Emiliano videotaped it. Not all of it—just enough. Just the parts that would make it clear what had happened, who she was, what she'd allowed him to do. He set his phone on the dresser and made sure the angle captured her face, her expressions, her enthusiastic participation.

"Why are you filming?" she asked afterward, pulling on her dress.

"Insurance," he said.

She laughed. "You're going to show it to him, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Good. He deserves it." She fixed her lipstick in the mirror, her hands steady. "He thinks he owns me. It'll be nice to remind him that he doesn't."

Emiliano sent the video to Tylerios that night, along with a message: "Thanks for letting me borrow her."

Tylerios Remancos was so ashamed, he committed suicide not more than ten years after the humiliation.

But that would come later. In the immediate aftermath, Tylerios did what powerful men always did when humiliated—he raged, he threatened, he tried to use his connections to destroy the upstart who'd dared to touch what was his.

But Emiliano was no longer the boy who'd been left bleeding on a sidewalk. He'd learned from that experience. He'd prepared.

And he had Sigyn.

Emiliano brought Sigyn Thornprikkenson out on dates, to brag to everyone about his trophy girlfriend. They went to the nicest restaurants in Tampa, to parties in Miami, to gallery openings in St. Petersburg. He dressed well—better than he could afford, but image was an investment—and she was stunning on his arm, turning heads wherever they went.

But it wasn't just about showing off. It was strategic.

This was during high school—Emiliano's senior year, that strange liminal space where he was technically still a student but had already begun operating in worlds that had nothing to do with homework or prom or college applications. Emiliano, the entrepreneurial spirit that he was, already had a heavy clout of influence.

The power in his blood had revealed itself to be more than just heat, more than just magnetism. It was something older, something that recognized patterns in chaos, that understood instinctively how systems worked, how people could be moved and motivated and manipulated. He saw connections that others missed, opportunities that others overlooked.

He struck deals with the police, the Mexican cartels, and the Nordics.

The police were easy—they were already corrupt, already looking the other way for the right price. Emiliano simply offered better prices and better information. He became useful to them, a source of tips about rival operations, a facilitator who could make problems disappear. In return, they gave him protection and advance warning when enforcement actions were planned.

The Mexican cartels were harder. They didn't trust outsiders, didn't like new players trying to enter their territory. But Emiliano had something they needed—connections to the Nordic networks that controlled the ports, the shipping routes, the legitimate businesses that could be used for laundering. He positioned himself as a bridge between two worlds that didn't usually talk to each other.

And the Nordics—the Nordics were the key to everything.

Without Sigyn by his side, the deals with the Nordics would have backfired. They were insular, suspicious of anyone who didn't share their heritage, their language, their particular brand of cold pragmatism. They would have seen Emiliano as just another ambitious Latino trying to climb above his station, would have used him and discarded him the way they'd discarded countless others.

But Sigyn changed the equation. She was one of them—Norwegian blood, the right connections, the right accent when she spoke their language. And she'd chosen Emiliano, which meant something. It meant he was worth paying attention to. It meant he was dangerous enough, interesting enough, powerful enough to steal the girlfriend of someone like Tylerios Remancos and make it stick.

Through her, he was able to secure long-term contracts for drug distribution, prostitution, and money laundering.

The drugs moved through legitimate shipping containers, buried under legal cargo, protected by paperwork that Sigyn's connections could manipulate. The prostitution operations were disguised as modeling agencies and entertainment services, staffed by women who came through the same Nordic networks that had brought Sigyn to Florida. The money laundering flowed through restaurants and real estate investments, through shell companies with names like "Baltic Ventures LLC" and "Midnight Sun Holdings."

Emiliano built his empire methodically, carefully, with the same intensity he'd once applied to winning Brittany Cluetrick's approval. But this was different. This was his. This was power that couldn't be taken away by people who thought they were better than him.

Sigyn was essential to all of it, but she was also something more. She understood him in a way Brittany never had. She didn't see him as a temporary rebellion or an ethnic curiosity. She saw him as what he was becoming—something dangerous and necessary and inevitable.

"You're not like other men," she told him one night, lying in the penthouse he'd rented with his new money, watching the lights of Clearwater Beach shimmer on the water below. "You have this thing inside you. This fire."

"You feel it?" he asked.

"Everyone feels it. Most people just don't know what they're feeling." She traced patterns on his chest with one finger. "That's why they're afraid of you. That's why they'll do what you tell them to do."

"What about you? Are you afraid?"

She smiled. "I'm Norwegian. We don't do fear. We do pragmatism. And pragmatically speaking, you're going to be very powerful someday. I'd rather be with you than against you."

It wasn't love. Neither of them pretended it was. But it was partnership, and in many ways that was better. More honest. More useful.

They were together for two years, building the foundation of everything that would come after. She taught him how to dress, how to speak to the Nordics, how to navigate their complicated hierarchies and unspoken rules. He taught her about the power in his blood, about the way reality bent around him when he wanted it badly enough, about the darkness he was cultivating to remake the world.

And somewhere in Florida, in a expensive apartment he couldn't afford to maintain, Tylerios Remancos drank himself into oblivion every night, unable to erase the image of his girlfriend with someone he'd considered beneath him, unable to recover from the humiliation.

It would take ten years, but eventually the shame would consume him completely. Eventually he would stand on the balcony of that same penthouse where Sigyn had once lived, where Emiliano had taken her from him, and he would step off into the air and fall and fall and fall until the pavement caught him.

But Emiliano didn't know that yet. Didn't need to know it. He'd already moved on, already left Tylerios Remancos in the rearview mirror of his accelerating life.

He was ameliorating himself, perfecting himself, transforming himself from the boy who'd been beaten on a sidewalk into something that could not be beaten, could not be broken, could not be stopped.

The darkness within him grew stronger every day, fed by ambition and rage and the particular satisfaction that came from proving everyone wrong, from taking what they said he couldn't have, from building an empire out of their contempt.

And through it all, Sigyn walked beside him—beautiful and cold and useful, the trophy girlfriend who was also the key to kingdoms, the Nordic bridge that connected him to networks of power that stretched across oceans.

Emiliano's first break-up had taught him about hate.

His second relationship was teaching him about empire.

And somewhere in the Florida heat, in the space between legal and illegal, between love and transaction, between the boy he'd been and the man he was becoming, the power in his blood sang with satisfaction.

This was what it had been waiting for.

This was what he'd been born to do.

And he was only just beginning.

## The Real Emiliano<a name="p5"></a>

At the young age of 25, Emiliano's empire was already rivaling the neo-Carnegie, post-Rockefeller commercial branches.

Seven years. That's all it had taken.

Seven years from that hospital bed where he'd lain broken and humiliated. Seven years from the moment the power in his blood had fully awakened. Seven years to build something that made the old American dynasties nervous, that made people whisper his name in boardrooms and back rooms and places where power was traded like currency.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes owned legitimate businesses—restaurants, real estate developments, import-export companies with offices in Tampa and Miami and São Paulo. But everyone who mattered knew that the legitimate ventures were just the surface, the respectable facade that allowed everything underneath to flourish. Beneath the corporate paperwork and tax filings ran rivers of narcotics, weapons, money, and influence that touched every level of Florida society.

He lived in a penthouse in downtown Tampa now, thirty floors above the street where ordinary people lived ordinary lives. From his windows, he could see the bay, could watch the ships coming and going, could track the flow of commerce—legal and otherwise—that he now controlled significant portions of.

The boy who'd been called a spic and beaten on a sidewalk no longer existed. In his place stood something else entirely.

Emiliano had many friends. One of them was Richard Pham.

They'd known each other in high school, though they'd never been close back then. Richard Pham was called a faggot in high school—not because he was gay, but because he was awkward and brilliant and different in ways that made cruel teenagers reach for the easiest insults. Richard Pham was kinda retarded and flunked physics, though Emiliano suspected the flunking had been intentional, a kind of rebellion against the expectations that crushed down on him from every direction.

Richard Pham also came from a household with a strong autocratic influence, from the Oriental Communist conflicts. His father had been a South Vietnamese officer who'd fled to America after the fall of Saigon, bringing with him all the trauma and rage and unprocessed grief of a lost war. His mother ruled the household with an iron fist, demanding academic excellence, cultural purity, and absolute obedience.

Richard Pham didn't identify as Vietnamese. He viewed them as an inferior and traitorous people. He saw the flaws of the South Vietnamese leadership in people such as his mother—stubborn, dictatorial, racist, and traditional. The kind of people who'd lost a country and blamed everyone but themselves.

"If the Vietnam War had occurred now and I was in Vietnam," Richard told Emiliano once, over drinks in a bar where no one asked questions, "I would join the Vietcong. At least they believed in something beyond their own survival."

Richard Pham disappeared from the social scene after high school, had to do extra years in college, and was treated like an outsider Jew during all of his academic years. He was too Asian for the white kids, too westernized for the Asian kids, too radical for everyone. He studied international relations and computer science and accumulated grievances the way other people accumulated credits.

Richard Pham tried to join the CIA. But the CIA was being run by Catholics—old-school Cold Warriors who saw communism under every rock and treated anyone with an Asian face as a potential security risk. They declared him a communist, despite his degrees and his desperation to prove his loyalty, despite everything he'd done to distance himself from his parents' failed ideology.

They tried to have him killed through their Filipino vassals—a botched operation in Manila where Richard had gone for what he'd thought was a final interview. He'd been smart enough to see it coming, paranoid enough to have an escape route, lucky enough to survive.

Richard survived, and seeing the state of affairs, Richard joined an extremist organization. He might have even converted to Islam—Emiliano was never sure about that part. The details were fuzzy, deliberately obscured. What was clear was that Richard had looked at America, at the CIA that had tried to kill him, at the society that had called him a faggot and treated him like a perpetual foreigner, and he'd decided to align himself with something else entirely.

Nothing was ever heard from him again in official channels, but he did lend Emiliano a hand in criminal operations.

Richard's skills—his computer expertise, his understanding of intelligence networks, his contacts in extremist organizations that operated in the shadows of the global order—proved invaluable. He helped Emiliano encrypt communications, launder money through cryptocurrency, hack into law enforcement databases to stay one step ahead of investigations.

They met in person rarely, communicated mostly through elaborate security protocols that Richard designed. But when they did meet, Emiliano saw in Richard something familiar—the same rage that he himself carried, the same determination to burn down the world that had tried to destroy them.

"You and I," Richard said once, "we're what happens when America eats its children."

Emiliano didn't disagree.

With Richard's help, Emiliano got hard drugs transported through Mexico, dealt the drugs to Florida elites, and even got some of them killed.

The fentanyl crisis was useful cover. When wealthy white executives and trust-fund heirs overdosed on product that Emiliano's network had deliberately cut with lethal doses, it barely made the news. Just another tragic victim of the opioid epidemic. Just another life destroyed by addiction.

But Emiliano knew better. Each death was intentional, calculated. These were the people who'd looked down on him, who'd treated people like his parents as disposable labor, who'd built their fortunes on the backs of people they considered lesser. Now they were dying by the thousands, and their deaths enriched him while simultaneously destabilizing the power structures that had kept people like him in check.

The white population in the US had been suffering from a backlash. Many people were no longer loyal to them, since the spread of populism and Christian extremism, they went from being role models to icons of domestic terrorism.

Emiliano watched the social fabric tear with satisfaction. The same people who'd once held unquestioned authority were now viewed with suspicion and contempt. The evangelical movements that had promised to restore American greatness had instead revealed the rot underneath—the racism, the hypocrisy, the violence that had always been there but was now impossible to ignore.

It created opportunities. When society fractured, when old alliances broke down, when people stopped trusting institutions, that's when someone like Emiliano could rise. That's when new empires could be built on the ruins of old certainties.

During that time, Brazil had just ousted its president, Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro affiliates jumped into Emiliano's businesses to lend him a hand.

They came with money and connections, with networks that stretched across South America, with the kind of political cover that Emiliano needed to expand beyond Florida. They were useful—ex-military officers, intelligence operatives, businessmen who'd profited under the Bolsonaro regime and now needed somewhere to land.

Emiliano welcomed them, integrated them into his operations, gave them positions of responsibility. They seemed grateful, loyal, eager to prove themselves in this new venture.

For six months, everything worked smoothly.

Then Emiliano discovered the truth.

It came through Richard, who'd intercepted communications he shouldn't have been able to access. A group chat. Videos. Evidence that the Bolsonaro affiliates had been meeting secretly, had been planning something, had been celebrating.

Once Emiliano discovered the Bolsonaro affiliates had group anal sex with Sigyn Thornprikkenson, Emiliano had them killed along with Sigyn.

He watched the video once. Just once. Saw Sigyn—his Sigyn, his bridge to the Nordic networks, his trophy and his tool—enthusiastically participating in something that looked exactly like what had destroyed Tylerios Remancos. Saw the Bolsonaro affiliates laughing, filming, treating her the way men always treated women they didn't respect.

The power in his blood roared to life with an intensity that made his vision go white.

He decided he was not going to be humiliated in the same way as Tylerios Remancos.

Tylerios had retreated, had let the shame consume him, had spent ten years drinking himself to death before finally stepping off that balcony. But Emiliano was not Tylerios. Emiliano had learned from that humiliation, had built an empire specifically so that he would never be powerless again.

He made the calls that night, his voice cold and certain.

The Bolsonaro affiliates died first. Car accidents, home invasions, overdoses—made to look random, unconnected, the kind of violence that happened to people involved in criminal enterprises. Richard helped orchestrate it, his extremist contacts proving useful for the kind of wet work that required absolute deniability.

Within two weeks, all five of them were dead.

Sigyn was harder. Not logistically—Emiliano could have had her killed as easily as the others. But emotionally. Despite everything, despite the transactional nature of their relationship, despite knowing that she'd never loved him the way he'd once loved Brittany, there was a hesitation.

He met her one last time, in the penthouse they'd shared, overlooking Clearwater Beach.

"You know," he said quietly.

She didn't deny it. Didn't apologize. Just looked at him with those winter-sky eyes and said, "It didn't mean anything."

"That's what makes it worse."

"Emiliano—"

"Did you think about me? When you were with them? Did you think about what it would do if I found out?"

"No." She was honest, at least. "I didn't think you'd find out. And honestly, I didn't think you'd care that much. We've never been..."

"What? In love?"

"Yes."

He laughed, though there was no humor in it. "You're right. We've never been in love. But we had an understanding. A partnership. And you broke it."

"So what now?"

"Now you leave. Tonight. Go back to Norway. Disappear. If I ever see you again, if I ever hear that you're talking about me or my business, you won't get another chance."

She studied his face, looking for weakness, for the possibility that he was bluffing. She found none.

"Okay," she said finally. "I'll go."

But Emiliano couldn't let her go. Not really. Not when there was a chance she'd talk, she'd become a liability, she'd tell someone about the things she knew, the networks she'd helped him build.

Richard made it look like an accident. A car crash on the way to the airport. Quick, clean, merciful even.

Emiliano watched the news report three days later, saw Sigyn Thornprikkenson's beautiful face on the screen, heard the anchor describe the tragic accident that had claimed the life of a Norwegian national. He felt nothing. Or rather, he felt the absence of feeling, which was somehow worse.

The real Emiliano had emerged fully now. Not the boy who'd been born with fire in his blood. Not the teenager who'd been beaten on a sidewalk. Not even the young man who'd built an empire on rage and ambition.

This was something colder. Something that had looked at betrayal and decided that mercy was a luxury he could no longer afford. Something that understood that power required the willingness to do what others wouldn't, to cross lines that others couldn't, to become what was necessary rather than what was good.

At twenty-five, Emiliano Santiago Reyes sat in his penthouse and looked out over Tampa Bay and knew that he had finally become what the power in his blood had always intended him to be.

Not a romantic. Not a lover. Not someone who converted love into hate.

Something beyond all that.

Something that the world would eventually have to reckon with.

Richard Pham sent him a message through their encrypted channel: "It's done. All of it."

Emiliano typed back: "Good."

Outside, the Florida sun set over the water, painting everything in shades of blood and fire. Ships moved through the bay, carrying cargo that Emiliano controlled, money that Emiliano laundered, products that Emiliano distributed.

The empire continued to grow.

The bodies were buried or burned or lost at sea.

And the real Emiliano—cold and calculating and utterly uncompromising—prepared for whatever came next, knowing that the world had no idea what was coming, what he was building, what he would eventually become.

The power in his blood sang with satisfaction.

This was only the beginning.

## The Menace of Emiliano's Tentacles<a name="p6"></a>

Emiliano's empire would have been the envy of the much-fabled Corleones from the Godfather Trilogy.

But where the Corleones had been limited by their time, by technology, by the provincial scope of mid-century organized crime, Emiliano operated in an age where borders meant nothing and money moved at the speed of light. His empire wasn't just vast—it was omnipresent, reaching into every corner of American life with tentacles that wrapped around everything they touched.

Oxycodone, Xanax bars, Hennessey, Hashish, he ran it all.

The pharmaceutical supply chains were Emiliano's masterpiece. He had people in manufacturing facilities, in distribution warehouses, in hospital pharmacies. Legitimate prescriptions were diverted, truck shipments were intercepted, inventory records were altered. Oxycodone flowed out of Florida by the millions of pills, feeding the addiction epidemic that had already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The Xanax bars came in through Mexico, pressed in labs that looked legitimate enough to fool casual inspection. The Hennessey was real—imported through his shipping networks and sold at a markup that made the profit margins on drugs look modest by comparison. The hashish came from everywhere—Morocco, Lebanon, Afghanistan—moved through Richard's extremist contacts and delivered to American consumers who had no idea their purchases were funding operations halfway around the world.

But drugs were just the foundation.

Robotics, AI, space satellites, he had stakes in all of it.

The legitimate tech sector had opened up in ways that old-school organized crime could never have imagined. Emiliano invested early in startups that were developing automation systems, artificial intelligence platforms, satellite communication networks. He used shell companies and venture capital funds, laundering his drug money into respectable investments that paid dividends and gave him access to cutting-edge technology.

The AI companies were particularly useful. Their machine learning algorithms could predict law enforcement patterns, optimize distribution routes, identify potential threats before they materialized. The robotics firms were developing automated systems that could package and transport product without human intervention, reducing the risk of informants and witnesses. The satellite companies gave him communications capabilities that were nearly impossible to intercept or trace.

Emiliano had become what the Corleones could never have imagined—a criminal empire that owned pieces of the future itself.

Money flowed through his organization like blood through a body, and Emiliano spent it with the casual indifference of someone who knew there would always be more.

Emiliano threw out million dollar gifts to his harlot skanks like it was nothing.

He kept a rotating collection of women—models, actresses, Instagram influencers, college students who were attracted to wealth and danger in equal measure. They weren't girlfriends, weren't partners in the way Sigyn had been. They were decorations, toys, disposable pleasures that he could discard when they became boring or demanding or too aware of what he actually did.

He bought them cars, jewelry, apartments. Sent them on shopping sprees that cost more than most people made in a year. The money meant nothing to him—it was just numbers in accounts, easily replenished, infinite in its generation.

But sometimes Emiliano's sense of humor took a darker turn.

One time, Emiliano wrapped up a harlot in a big gift box and shipped the box to his affiliate, Richard Pham.

Her name was Madison or Morgan or something equally forgettable. She'd been asking too many questions, getting too curious about where the money came from, starting to become a liability. So Emiliano had drugged her champagne at dinner one night, waited for her to pass out, and then carefully packaged her in a custom-made crate with air holes and padding.

The shipping label read: "Fragile: Live Animal. Handle with Care."

He sent it through one of his freight companies, expedited international delivery to an address in Jakarta where Richard—or whatever he was calling himself now—operated.

The harlot was still alive upon arrival, but Richard Pham had been indoctrinated into an extremist organization at that point in time. Richard Pham had changed his name to Tensuramoto, and was in the process of helping terrorists move product through Asia.

The name change was symbolic—a rejection of the Vietnamese identity his parents had tried to force on him, an adoption of something that sounded vaguely Japanese but was probably made up. Tensuramoto had become someone else entirely, someone who moved through the shadows of Southeast Asia coordinating shipments of weapons and drugs, someone who'd decided that if the West had rejected him, he would burn the West down.

When the crate arrived, Tensuramoto opened it to find a confused, terrified woman who spoke no Indonesian and had no idea where she was or how she'd gotten there.

He'd looked at her for a long moment, this gift from his old friend, this joke that was also a test, this reminder of the bond they'd once shared and the different paths they'd taken.

Tensuramoto decapitated the harlot and sent her head back to Emiliano.

It arrived in a cooler packed with dry ice, delivered by a courier who had no idea what he was carrying. There was a note inside, written in neat handwriting:

"The rift between East and West cannot be bridged with whores. But I appreciate the gesture."

The rift between the East and West had deepened significantly since the Russia-Ukraine War and the United States's global trade war. Emiliano was Western, but Tensuramoto had turned back to his Eastern roots.

They maintained their business relationship—it was too profitable for both of them to let ideology get in the way—but the friendship had curdled into something else. Something colder. Transactional rather than personal.

Emiliano understood. In a way, he respected it. Tensuramoto had chosen his side, had committed fully to a vision of the world that put him in opposition to everything Emiliano represented. That took a certain kind of integrity, even if the integrity was in service of extremism and violence.

The head went into the bay that night, weighted down with chains, sent to join all the other bodies that had accumulated over the years.

Emiliano needed people he could actually trust, people who hadn't been radicalized or turned into something unrecognizable.

He relied on his friend back from high school, Joseph Clayton.

Joseph Clayton was a hopeless romantic during his middle school years, but upon reaching high school, Joseph Clayton made no hesitations to show all the girls there what an utter romantic he was.

Where Emiliano had been calculating and strategic in his conquests, Joseph had been genuinely romantic—writing poetry, bringing flowers, believing in love with an earnestness that should have been laughable but somehow worked. Girls had fallen for him in droves, drawn to his sincerity, his passion, his complete commitment to the romantic ideal.

Joseph Clayton had much sex with Maryann Clayton, Jessay Clayton, Mary Clayton, Lauren Clayton, Jordan Clayton, and Elana Clayton. All these women became Joseph Clayton's wives.

He'd converted to a fundamentalist Mormon sect in his early twenties, one of the splinter groups that still practiced plural marriage. It was perfect cover for his actual role in Emiliano's organization—the wives ran legitimate businesses that laundered money, the large family provided excuses for irregular schedules and frequent travel, and the religious community's insularity meant that law enforcement had difficulty penetrating their operations.

Joseph handled the real estate side of things—buying properties with cash, renting them to shell companies, using the rental income to justify the movement of drug money. The wives were smart, loyal, and completely devoted to Joseph, which meant they were loyal to Emiliano by extension.

"It's biblical," Joseph explained once, when Emiliano had asked how he managed six wives. "Solomon had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. I'm actually showing restraint."

Emiliano also employed the help of Joshua Polanski and Esteban Hernandez, complete homosexuals, the first openly gay couple at Emiliano's high school.

They were always making out with each other in the hallway then, back when being openly gay was still enough of a novelty to draw stares and whispers. They'd been brave in a way that Emiliano respected—refusing to hide, refusing to pretend, claiming space in a world that didn't want to give it to them.

Nowadays, they remained tight as nails. Married now, legally and legitimately, living in a tastefully decorated townhouse in Tampa's historic district.

Polanski and Hernandez trafficked drugs and whores for Emiliano.

They ran the clubs—the high-end establishments where Tampa's elite came to indulge their vices, where drugs flowed freely and beautiful women were always available for the right price. Polanski handled security and logistics, his background in computer science making him invaluable for surveillance systems and digital security. Hernandez managed the talent—recruiting the women, managing their schedules, ensuring they were kept happy enough to stay loyal and scared enough not to talk.

They were good at it. Ruthlessly efficient. The clubs generated millions in revenue while also serving as gathering places for information—drunk executives talked, and Polanski and Hernandez made sure everything was recorded, catalogued, ready to be used when leverage was needed.

It was great extra business for Emiliano, since the American economy had collapsed under the weight of the elites' excuses of A.I. lies.

The promised automation revolution had arrived, but instead of creating prosperity, it had created a permanent underclass of unemployed workers who couldn't compete with machines. The elites had claimed that AI would free humanity from drudgery, would create new opportunities, would usher in a golden age of leisure and creativity.

Instead, it had concentrated wealth even further, eliminated millions of jobs, and created a desperate population that turned to drugs and escapism because the future they'd been promised had been a lie.

Emiliano profited from every angle. The despair drove drug sales. The unemployment created a steady supply of people willing to work for his organization. The economic collapse meant that law enforcement was underfunded and overwhelmed, unable to effectively combat the sprawling criminal enterprise he'd built.

His tentacles reached everywhere now. Into the pharmaceutical companies and the tech startups. Into the legitimate businesses and the underground economy. Into the halls of power where politicians took his money and looked the other way. Into the police departments where officers supplemented their shrinking salaries by feeding him information.

Joseph Clayton and his six wives laundering money through real estate. Polanski and Hernandez running clubs where the elite came to forget their problems. Tensuramoto moving product through Asia, even as their friendship dissolved into mutual recognition that they'd chosen opposite sides of a civilizational conflict.

The Corleones had ruled New York for a generation, maybe two, before the law caught up with them, before their empire crumbled under its own contradictions.

But Emiliano was building something different. Something more durable. Something that didn't just exploit the weaknesses of society but had become woven into the fabric of how society functioned.

He sat in his penthouse office, looking at screens that showed real-time data from his operations—shipments moving through ports, money flowing through accounts, products being distributed across the country. The power in his blood hummed with satisfaction, with the recognition that this was what it had always been building toward.

Not love. Not revenge. Not even wealth or power for their own sake.

But the complete transformation of the world into something that bent around him, that existed to serve his will, that couldn't function without him at its center.

The menace of Emiliano's tentacles had spread so far, had gripped so tightly, that trying to remove them now would require tearing down the entire system they'd become integrated with.

And no one had the courage or the power to do that.

So the empire grew, the tentacles spread, and Emiliano Santiago Reyes—once a boy born with fire in his blood, now a man who'd turned that fire into an engine of transformation—prepared for whatever came next.

The real question wasn't whether his empire would fall.

It was whether there would be anything left of America when it finally did.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Emiliano Kills The DEA and FBI<a name="p7"></a>

The United States, at that point in time, had gone rampant and the officials were aggravating the conditions even further.

By the time Emiliano reached his mid-thirties, America had fractured in ways that would have been unimaginable a generation earlier. The federal government lurched from crisis to crisis, its legitimacy eroding with each scandal, each failure, each revelation of corruption that went unpunished. The DEA and FBI, once feared institutions that had brought down mob bosses and drug kingpins, were now shadows of their former selves—underfunded, demoralized, compromised by the very criminals they were supposed to be fighting.

The officials weren't just failing to stop the collapse. They were accelerating it. Every heavy-handed raid alienated communities. Every corrupt agent exposed destroyed public trust. Every bureaucratic failure created more space for people like Emiliano to operate.

It was a perfect storm of institutional decay, and Emiliano rode it like a surfer catching the wave of his life.

It was easy for Emiliano to kill almost all DEA and FBI agents that crossed his path.

Not personally, of course. Emiliano hadn't pulled a trigger in years. He didn't need to. He had people for that—professionals, specialists, true believers who saw federal agents as the enemy and were happy to eliminate them for the right price or the right cause.

But more importantly, he had information. The AI systems he'd invested in, the surveillance networks he'd built, the corrupt officials on his payroll—all of it combined to create a intelligence apparatus that rivaled what the government itself possessed. He knew where agents lived. Where they ate lunch. Where their children went to school. Where their weaknesses were.

Most agents, when they realized how exposed they were, backed off. Took reassignments. Retired early. Decided that their pension wasn't worth dying for.

But some were true believers. Some thought they were heroes. Some couldn't be bought or scared off.

DEA agents Jakob Keen and Stephen McNamara were annihilated by him.

Jakob Keen had been tracking Emiliano's pharmaceutical supply chain for three years. He was smart, dedicated, incorruptible—everything that made for a good agent and a dead man. He'd gotten close, too close, had started making connections that threatened to expose the entire network of doctors and pharmacists and distributors that kept the oxycodone flowing.

Emiliano had tried the gentle approach first. Had people reach out with offers of money, with threats against Keen's family, with promises that he could look the other way and no one would blame him.

Keen refused everything.

So Emiliano made a call, and three days later Jakob Keen's car exploded in his driveway. The investigation concluded it was a mechanical failure, a faulty fuel line. No one looked too closely. No one wanted to look too closely.

Stephen McNamara was FBI, assigned to a task force investigating Emiliano's ties to extremist organizations. He'd been building a RICO case, documenting connections, following money trails, getting close to indictments that could have brought down significant portions of the empire.

McNamara's death was more creative. Emiliano had people plant evidence that McNamara was actually working for a rival criminal organization, that he was corrupt, that his entire investigation was designed to eliminate Emiliano as competition. The evidence was convincing enough that McNamara's own agency turned on him. He was arrested, disgraced, and then—before he could defend himself or expose the frameup—he hung himself in his cell.

At least, that's what the official report said.

There were others. Dozens of others over the years. Agents who got too close, asked too many questions, refused to be bought or intimidated. They had accidents. They committed suicide. They were reassigned to Alaska and never heard from again. They retired suddenly and moved to remote locations where no one could find them.

The message was clear: investigate Emiliano Santiago Reyes at your own peril.

But even as he consolidated power domestically, Emiliano had to deal with complications abroad.

Emiliano also employed disaffected cartel members to kill Richard Pham (Tensuramoto), after hearing that he was working with extremist groups to stage a terrorist attack in China.

The intelligence came through multiple channels—intercepted communications, reports from contacts in Southeast Asia, warnings from Chinese business partners who'd gotten wind of something big being planned. Tensuramoto, his old friend who'd become something else entirely, was coordinating with Islamic extremist groups to launch an attack on Chinese infrastructure. Something big. Something that would kill thousands and destabilize the entire region.

Emiliano couldn't have someone like that linked to him. Emiliano had too many business contacts and factories in China.

The irony wasn't lost on him. He'd built an empire on violence and drugs, had killed federal agents and corrupted entire institutions, had destroyed countless lives in pursuit of power. But a terrorist attack in China? That crossed a line. Not a moral line—Emiliano had stopped pretending to care about morality years ago—but a practical one.

China was too important. The factories that manufactured his legitimate products. The financial networks that laundered his money. The political connections that gave him legitimacy on the world stage. A terrorist attack linked to someone in his orbit would destroy all of that, would bring down a level of scrutiny and retaliation that even his empire couldn't withstand.

So he made the call.

The disaffected cartel members were easy to find—men who'd been pushed aside by newer, younger sicarios, who resented Tensuramoto's arrogance and his extremist ideology, who were happy to eliminate him for the right price and the promise of better positions in Emiliano's organization.

They found Tensuramoto in Jakarta, in a safe house that wasn't as safe as he'd thought. The operation was quick, professional, brutal. No manifesto. No explanation. Just a body that was discovered three days later, decomposing in the tropical heat.

Emiliano felt nothing when he heard. His old friend from high school, the kid who'd been called a faggot and tried to join the CIA and ended up becoming a terrorist—he was gone now, erased, another casualty of the world they'd both helped create.

The terrorist attack never happened. The Chinese authorities never knew how close they'd come. Emiliano's business contacts in Beijing sent him expensive gifts and expressed their continued eagerness to work together.

The empire rolled on.

In the last decade of Emiliano's life, he looks back and sees his accomplishments for what they are.

He was fifty now, though he looked younger—good genes, better doctors, a life lived without the stress that destroyed ordinary men. He stood on the balcony of his penthouse in Tampa, the same penthouse he'd owned for twenty-five years, and looked out at a city that had transformed beyond recognition.

The Florida he'd been born into—the Florida of his parents, of sponge divers and fish houses and small immigrant communities struggling to survive—was gone. In its place was something else. Something new.

He had been part of a Hispanicization movement that had toppled the white supremacist establishment of America.

It hadn't been intentional, not at first. Emiliano had been focused on building his empire, on destroying his enemies, on accumulating power for its own sake. But in doing so, he'd been part of something larger—a demographic and cultural shift that had fundamentally altered the American power structure.

Multinational corporations headquartered in America had started to speak Spanish instead of English.

Not exclusively, of course. But Spanish had become the language of business in the same way English had once been. Board meetings were conducted in Spanish. Internal memos were written in Spanish. The assumption was that if you wanted to succeed in American business, you spoke Spanish fluently.

Corporate CEOs were virtually all Hispanic.

The Fortune 500 was dominated by names like Rodriguez and Garcia and Hernandez. The old Anglo establishment—the families that had run America for generations—had either adapted or been swept aside. Their children spoke Spanish, married into Hispanic families, tried desperately to maintain relevance in a world that no longer centered them.

The most renowned scientists in the country were now Hispanic.

The universities, the research institutions, the tech companies—all staffed primarily by Hispanic scientists and engineers who'd grown up in a world where they were told they could achieve anything, and who'd proven it to be true. The Nobel Prizes went to Hispanic researchers. The breakthrough technologies came from Hispanic entrepreneurs. The future was being built by people who looked like Emiliano's parents.

Chinese corporations had to bow down to people such as Emiliano.

The balance of power had shifted. China was still powerful, still growing, still a rival. But they needed access to American markets, American consumers, American networks of distribution. And those networks were controlled by people like Emiliano—Hispanic businessmen who straddled the line between legitimate and criminal, who could open doors or close them depending on how they were treated.

Chinese executives flew to Tampa to meet with Emiliano, to negotiate deals, to pay tribute in the form of favorable contracts and technology transfers. They called him "Mr. Reyes" and brought expensive gifts and treated him with the respect due to someone who held their fate in his hands.

Emiliano's side arms industry ran Vatican City.

The Catholic Church, desperate for protection in an increasingly unstable world, had turned to private security firms to guard its vast holdings. Emiliano owned the largest of these firms, which meant he controlled access to the Vatican, influenced who could and couldn't enter, had leverage over one of the world's oldest and most powerful institutions.

The Pope himself—a Hispanic man from Argentina—had met with Emiliano twice, blessing his "charitable work" while carefully not asking too many questions about where the money came from.

This was empire.

Not the kind that conquered territory or raised flags. Not the kind that history books traditionally celebrated. But empire nonetheless—a network of power and influence and control that spanned continents and shaped the lives of millions.

Emiliano was victorious, after all.

He'd started as nothing—a boy born in a fish house in Tarpon Springs, the son of immigrants, marked from birth by power he didn't understand. He'd been beaten, humiliated, told implicitly and explicitly that people like him would never matter, could never rise, should be grateful for whatever scraps the powerful chose to throw them.

And he'd taken that rage, that humiliation, that fire in his blood, and he'd used it to burn down the world that had tried to destroy him.

Not literally, of course. The world still turned. People still lived their lives. But the structure of power, the assumptions about who mattered and who didn't, the unquestioned supremacy of one group over another—all of that had been fundamentally altered.

And Emiliano had been the catalyst, the accelerant, the match that lit the fire.

He thought about Brittany Cluetrick sometimes, wondered what had become of her. Probably married to a lawyer or a banker, living in Connecticut, raising children who spoke Spanish because that's what you did now if you wanted them to succeed. She'd been his first lesson in power—how it was taken, how it was lost, how temporary it could be if you didn't know how to hold onto it.

He thought about Cameron Hasbeen, about the Anglo-Germanic bosses who'd beaten him bloody on that sidewalk. Most of them were dead now—overdoses, mostly, victims of the very drugs Emiliano had flooded their communities with. Poetic justice, if you believed in such things.

He thought about Sigyn, about Tensuramoto, about all the people he'd used and discarded and destroyed on his way to the top. He felt nothing for them. No guilt, no regret, no satisfaction. They were just names in a catalog of victories, proof that he'd been willing to do what others wouldn't.

The power in his blood—that strange heat that had pulsed from him since birth, that had guided him and shaped him and made him into something more than human—it sang quietly now. Contentedly. Like a beast that had been fed and was sleeping peacefully.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes, at fifty years old, stood at the pinnacle of an empire that would have been inconceivable to the boy he'd once been.

He'd killed federal agents. He'd destroyed institutions. He'd corrupted governments and infiltrated corporations and reshaped the very fabric of American society.

And when he looked back at his life, at everything he'd accomplished, at the world he'd helped create, he felt no doubt, no uncertainty, no questioning of whether it had been worth it.

Of course it had been worth it.

Because he'd won.

And in the end, Emiliano had learned, winning was the only thing that mattered.

The sun set over Tampa Bay, painting the sky in shades of orange and red and gold. Ships moved through the water, carrying cargo that Emiliano owned or controlled or had interest in. The city lights began to glow as darkness fell, and somewhere in that city, in all the cities across America, people were using his products, working in his businesses, living in the world he'd helped shape.

Such utter romantics of Florida, they'd been. He and all the others who'd believed in something more, who'd refused to accept the limits the world tried to impose, who'd had the audacity to dream of empire in an age that claimed empire was impossible.

Of fiction and fantasia, perhaps. But fiction had become reality, and fantasia had been made manifest.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, standing on his balcony as night fell over Florida, knew that his story—his impossible, violent, triumphant story—would echo long after he was gone.

The boy born with fire in his blood had set the world ablaze.

And from those ashes, something new had risen.

His victory was complete.

## The Supreme Leader Emiliano's Funeral<a name="p8"></a>

So many accolades, Nobel Prizes, at the funeral.

They lined the walls of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, encased in glass and lit by spotlights that made them glow like holy relics. The Nobel Prize in Economics, awarded for his "revolutionary contributions to global trade theory." The Nobel Peace Prize, given for his "instrumental role in mediating conflicts between Eastern and Western powers." Three separate Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Medicine, technically awarded to research institutions he'd funded, but everyone knew who'd made the breakthroughs possible.

There were others too—the Presidential Medal of Freedom, honorary doctorates from Harvard and Oxford and Beijing University, humanitarian awards from organizations that bore his name, commendations from governments across the globe. They covered the cathedral walls like the stations of the cross, marking the milestones of a life that had transcended anything that could be measured by ordinary standards.

Oxycodone, xanax bars, mollies. An extravagant funeral for a great man.

The distribution was handled discreetly, of course. Attendants in somber black suits moved through the crowd with silver trays, offering pills alongside champagne and canapés. It was tradition now—Emiliano's traditions, the ones he'd established over decades of reshaping society to his specifications. No one batted an eye. Heads of state popped xanax bars before their eulogies to calm their nerves. CEOs dropped mollies and embraced each other, crying about the loss of their greatest patron. The elderly took their oxycodone openly, pain management that doubled as tribute.

The cathedral itself was a masterpiece of excess. Every surface dripped with flowers—orchids from Colombia, roses from Ecuador, lilies from Mexico. The air was thick with their perfume, almost narcotic in its intensity. Screens mounted between the stained glass windows showed footage from Emiliano's life—the official version, carefully curated, showing the philanthropist, the businessman, the visionary who'd transformed America and the world.

The casket was solid platinum, custom-made, weighing over a thousand pounds. It sat on a raised dais at the front of the cathedral, surrounded by candles and flowers and honor guards in dress uniforms from a dozen different countries. Inside, Emiliano lay in his finest suit, his hands folded over his chest, his face peaceful in death in a way it had never been in life.

The year was 2080. Emiliano, the man that bested the Corleones a million times over, and much more influential than any megalomaniacal American president in history.

He had lived to be ninety-five, though the official records said ninety-two—a small vanity, even at the end. His mind had stayed sharp until the very end, his empire functioning flawlessly even as his body slowly failed him. He'd died in his sleep in the penthouse in Tampa, the same penthouse he'd owned for seventy years, looking out over a city and a world that bore his fingerprints on every surface.

The Corleones, those mythical gangsters from a different age, had controlled New York for perhaps two generations. They'd been powerful, certainly. Legendary, even. But their empire had crumbled, their family had scattered, and within a few decades they'd been reduced to footnotes in history books and characters in movies.

Emiliano had built something that lasted. Something that had become woven into the fabric of civilization itself. You couldn't remove his influence without unraveling everything. The drug trade, the legitimate corporations, the political networks, the cultural transformation—it was all his legacy, all bearing his mark, all continuing long after his death.

Presidents had come and gone. Some had tried to challenge him, to reassert federal authority, to restore some mythical version of American greatness that had never actually existed. They'd all failed. Some had been destroyed by scandals that Emiliano orchestrated. Others had simply been outmaneuvered, rendered irrelevant by forces they couldn't understand or control.

No American president—not Washington, not Lincoln, not Roosevelt—had shaped the nation as profoundly as Emiliano Santiago Reyes. And he'd done it without ever holding elected office, without ever claiming formal power, without ever pretending to be anything other than what he was.

The funeral stretched over three days. It was part memorial, part celebration, part political convention. Everyone who mattered in the world was there, paying their respects to the man who'd held their fates in his hands.

On the first day, the politicians came. The President of the United States—a Hispanic woman from Texas who'd built her career with Emiliano's backing—delivered a eulogy that brought the crowd to tears. She spoke of his generosity, his vision, his unwavering commitment to the Hispanic community. She didn't mention the drugs, the murders, the corruption. Everyone knew, but no one spoke of it. That was the agreement, the fiction that allowed society to function.

The Chinese Premier sent a video message, praising Emiliano's role in facilitating trade between East and West. The Pope—the third Hispanic Pope in a row, a tradition that Emiliano had helped establish—led a special mass and called him "a son of the Church who never forgot his faith."

On the second day, the business community took center stage. CEOs from every major corporation gave testimonials about Emiliano's business acumen, his innovative thinking, his ability to see opportunities that others missed. They talked about the factories he'd built, the jobs he'd created, the technologies he'd funded. The irony that many of them had started their careers working in his drug distribution networks went unmentioned.

Joseph Clayton was there, now in his seventies, his six wives standing behind him in matching black dresses. He spoke about loyalty and friendship and the importance of family—biological and chosen. He didn't mention the money laundering or the real estate schemes or the countless crimes they'd committed together. Just warm memories of a lifelong friendship.

Joshua Polanski and Esteban Hernandez, both in their eighties, stood together at the podium and spoke about how Emiliano had supported them when no one else would, how he'd given them opportunities, how he'd never judged them for who they loved. The clubs they'd run, the women they'd trafficked, the lives destroyed—all of it was glossed over in favor of a narrative about acceptance and brotherhood.

On the third day, the masses came. Thousands of people who'd worked for Emiliano's companies, who'd benefited from his charitable foundations, who'd used his products and lived in his buildings and existed within the systems he'd created. They filed past the platinum casket, crossing themselves, leaving flowers, weeping for a man most of them had never met but whose influence had touched every aspect of their lives.

The cathedral could only hold a few thousand at a time, so the viewing continued around the clock. Outside, vendors sold food and drinks and memorabilia—t-shirts with Emiliano's face, commemorative coins, even small vials of pills marked "In Loving Memory." It was carnival and funeral combined, grief and celebration inseparable.

The speeches were endless. Scientists talked about the research he'd funded. Artists discussed the galleries and museums that bore his name. Educators praised the schools and universities he'd built. Everyone had a story about Emiliano's generosity, his vision, his impact on their lives.

No one mentioned Cameron Hasbeen, who'd died of an overdose at nineteen. No one talked about Brittany Cluetrick, who'd achieved everything she'd wanted in life but whose name was now a footnote in Emiliano's mythology. No one spoke of Tylerios Remancos, who'd jumped from a balcony after being humiliated. No one remembered the DEA agents, the FBI investigators, the rival criminals, the women who'd been used and discarded.

History was written by the victors, and Emiliano had won so completely that there were no competing narratives left to challenge his version of events.

On the evening of the third day, as the sun set over St. Augustine, they sealed the platinum casket and began the procession to the mausoleum. It had been built specifically for Emiliano—a massive structure on the grounds of the cathedral, designed to resemble a temple, funded by donations from his corporate empire.

The procession stretched for miles. Military honor guards from a dozen countries. Motorcycle escorts from police departments he'd owned. Mourners by the hundreds of thousands, lining the streets, holding candles, singing hymns in Spanish and English and Chinese and Arabic.

Inside the mausoleum, they placed the casket in a tomb of marble and gold. Above it, carved in letters three feet tall, were the words:

EMILIANO SANTIAGO REYES
1985-2080
VISIONARY, PHILANTHROPIST, LIBERATOR
"HIS POWER MADE HISTORY"

Below that, smaller but still prominent:

"SUCH UTTER ROMANTICS OF FLORIDA:
OF FICTION AND FANTASIA"

The tomb was sealed with ceremony and prayer and more drugs—offerings to speed his journey to whatever came next, though no one really believed Emiliano needed help getting anywhere he wanted to go.

The mourners filed out slowly, reluctantly, as if leaving meant accepting that the era of Emiliano was truly over. Outside, the celebration continued. Music played, people danced, drugs flowed freely. It was grief and joy intertwined, mourning and gratitude, the end of an age and the continuation of everything he'd built.

Because that was Emiliano's final victory—he'd made himself irreplaceable while simultaneously ensuring that his empire would continue without him. The systems he'd created were self-sustaining now. The culture he'd shaped had become the new normal. The power structure he'd established would persist for generations.

His children—legitimate and otherwise—held positions throughout the empire. His grandchildren were being groomed to take over. His great-grandchildren would inherit a world that Emiliano had fundamentally transformed.

In Tampa, in his old penthouse that had been converted into a museum, visitors would soon come to see his possessions, to walk through the rooms where he'd planned his conquests, to stand on the balcony where he'd surveyed his domain. They'd learn about the boy born in a fish house who'd grown up to reshape America. They'd hear about the passion and the vision and the unstoppable drive.

They wouldn't hear about the violence, the corruption, the countless destroyed lives. Or if they did hear about it, it would be presented as unfortunate but necessary, the price that had to be paid for progress, the dark side of genius that made the bright side possible.

In the mausoleum, in his platinum tomb, Emiliano lay still and silent for the first time in ninety-five years. The power that had pulsed in his blood since birth, that strange heat that had marked him as different from the moment he was born, had finally gone quiet.

But its effects would echo for centuries.

The Hispanicization of America was complete and irreversible. The old Anglo power structure had been dismantled and would never return. The drug trade had been normalized, integrated into society so thoroughly that trying to eliminate it would require destroying modern civilization itself. The corruption had become so systematic that it was simply how things worked now.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes had won not just for himself, but for everyone who came after him. He'd proven that power wasn't about birthright or skin color or old family names. It was about will, about vision, about the willingness to do whatever was necessary to achieve victory.

As the last mourners left the mausoleum and the doors were sealed, as the guards took their positions and the candles burned low, as the world slowly accepted that Emiliano was truly gone, one truth remained undeniable:

He had been born with fire in his blood, and he had set the world ablaze.

And when the flames finally died down, everything had been transformed—society, culture, power itself—into something that bore his image, his will, his inescapable influence.

The funeral was over.

The legend had just begun.

And somewhere in Florida—in the heat and the humidity, in the space between land and sea, in that liminal place where reality had always been thinner than elsewhere—the power that had made Emiliano what he was continued to hum, waiting for the next person who would be born with fire in their blood, waiting to wake again, waiting to remake the world one more time.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these people born in that strange peninsula where anything seemed possible and often was.

Of fiction and fantasia, they lived and died and left behind legacies that defied logic and reason.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, lying in his platinum tomb beneath tons of marble and gold, had proven once and for all that the most impossible stories were the ones that actually came true.

His power had never made history if he had not been brought into this world.

But he had been.

And everything—everything—had changed because of it.

The End.

## Emiliano's Associates in His Rise to Power

As mentioned in the first part, Emiliano had quite some notable associates in his rise to power, during a time when the United States was hispanicizing its populace.

The transformation was not subtle. Anyone walking through Miami, Tampa, Phoenix, or Los Angeles in the early 2000s could see it happening in real time—Spanish on billboards, mariachi music bleeding from open car windows, restaurants where English was the second language if it was spoken at all. But this was not merely demographic drift. This was orchestrated change, facilitated by forces that understood how power worked in the modern world.

The hispanicization of this country was no mere coincidence. Besides from some of the prominent members of high-society that viewed the influx of immigrants as positively correlated to more servant labor, these being the liberals that are of mysterious origins, arising sometime after the Second World War when Western prestige granted them the power of a kind of bankership instead of militarism as the greatest form of political finesse.

These liberals—whose families often traced back to European banking houses, to merchant classes that had survived every regime change by understanding that money was more durable than ideology—had seen the future clearly. The old model of American power, built on manufacturing and military might, was giving way to something more abstract: financial instruments, information control, service economies. They needed workers who would accept lower wages, who came from cultures that respected hierarchy, who could be managed more easily than the entitled native-born population that had grown comfortable in postwar prosperity.

The immigration policy shifts, the border enforcement changes, the political rhetoric about "comprehensive reform"—all of it served this purpose, though it was never stated so baldly in public.

The success of the liberals, although fading at the time when Emiliano started his unquestionable rise to power, was great enough for even the ultra-conservative wing of the United States political apparatus to uphold, albeit they did so with much greater exclusion and officiation, a new kind of American royalty that was once so repugnant to their immigrant ancestors escaping Old World hierarchies.

The conservatives had discovered that they could have their cake and eat it too. They could rail against immigration in public while privately employing undocumented workers in their businesses. They could claim to defend American values while creating a permanent underclass that made their wealth possible. And in doing so, they became exactly what their ancestors had fled—an aristocracy based not on bloodline but on the ability to exploit those below them in the hierarchy.

America was too new to diverge that greatly into free enterprise without structure. The frontier was closed. The land was claimed. The opportunities that had once allowed any ambitious person to strike out and build something from nothing had been consolidated into corporate hands. Structure was inevitable, and that structure increasingly resembled the Old World systems that Americans had once prided themselves on rejecting.

The language of English seemed to imitate the trajectory of French as the lingua franca. Just as French had once been the language of diplomacy and culture, spoken by elites across Europe even as their native populations spoke other tongues, English was beginning to fracture. It remained the language of global business and technology, but in America itself, Spanish was rising. Not replacing English entirely, but creating a bilingual reality where one's fluency in Spanish determined access to opportunities, to social networks, to power itself.

The US military both Catholicized and hispanicized in very apparent form since the beginning of the War on Terror in 2001. The recruitment offices in Texas and California and Florida filled with young Hispanic men and women seeking citizenship, education, escape from poverty. The Catholic chaplains multiplied, saying masses in Spanish on bases from Fort Hood to Kandahar. The military—that most American of institutions—was transforming from the inside, becoming something that would have been unrecognizable to the WASP officer corps of World War II.

And that meant a diversion of economic opportunities for lesser identities in historical America.

The groups that had once held positions of modest privilege—the ethnic whites of Eastern European descent, the Asians who'd achieved model minority status, the educated blacks who'd climbed into the professional class—found themselves squeezed. The Hispanic wave was too large, too organized, too well-connected to the emerging power structures. Resources were finite. Jobs were limited. And the reallocation was brutal for those caught on the wrong side of it.

One associate of Emiliano was Richard Pham.

Richard Pham, as mentioned in the previous part, disowned ethnic identity to Vietnam. This was not a casual disavowal. Richard had grown up watching his parents cling to a country that no longer existed, mourning a war they'd lost, maintaining cultural practices that meant nothing to him. His father's stories of fighting the communists, his mother's insistence on Vietnamese traditions, the community gatherings where old men relived battles from forty years ago—all of it struck Richard as pathetic, a refusal to accept reality.

"Vietnam is dead," he'd told his father once, during a particularly bitter argument. "You're mourning a corpse."

His father had slapped him. His mother had cried. The community elders had looked at him with disgust. But Richard had meant it. The Vietnam of his parents' imagination—the democratic, American-aligned South that would have been a beacon of capitalism in Southeast Asia—had never actually existed. It had been a corrupt client state that collapsed the moment American support wavered. Mourning it was like mourning a beautiful lie.

Richard Pham had other issues as well, growing up in a country where institutions and tech titans already had too many marginal peoples to accommodate those of his character.

By the time Richard reached adulthood, the tech industry had thoroughly embraced diversity as a PR strategy. But their diversity was selective—they wanted the right kind of Asians (Chinese and Indians primarily, preferably from elite universities), the right kind of women (ambitious but not too demanding), the right kind of minorities (those who wouldn't make white executives uncomfortable). Richard, with his complicated background and prickly personality and refusal to play the model minority role, didn't fit any of their categories.

It didn't help Richard Pham that he was frequently called Chinese during his formative years.

"Hey, Chinese kid!" in middle school hallways. "You speak Chinese?" at job interviews. "Like, are you Chinese or Japanese or what?" from girls he tried to talk to at parties.

But that was forgivable, since appearances are the first thing someone sees.

Richard understood the logic, even as he resented it. People categorized by appearance because it was efficient, because detailed inquiry took effort, because most didn't care enough to learn the difference between Vietnamese and Chinese and Thai and Korean. From a distance, all Asians looked alike to people who didn't bother to look closely.

Being Chinese in the United States is a double-edged sword. The Chinese merchant class has always enjoyed privilege of commerce since the ancient Roman era. They are, in fact, the most prominent East Asian civilization.

The Chinese had networks, capital, connections that stretched back centuries. The overseas Chinese diaspora had built commercial empires across Southeast Asia, had survived every political upheaval by understanding that business transcended ideology. Being mistaken for Chinese could open doors, could create assumptions of competence and business acumen.

Chinese peasantry, on the other hand, as well as intellectuals had to go through less romantic ordeals. The peasantry suffer everywhere as much as the institutions of wealth distribution allow them to. The peasantry also become conditioned to not diverge too greatly from their pre-assignments.

The poor Chinese were still poor. They worked in restaurants and laundries and garment factories, invisible to the Americans who benefited from their labor. They lived in crowded apartments and sent money back home and died without having achieved the American dream they'd been promised. The conditioning was thorough—work hard, don't complain, don't expect too much, accept your place.

Intellectuals are a mixed bag, since the ones that do not get taken up by corporate titans turn to government contract work for the Chinese Communist Party.

The bright ones, the ones with degrees from Tsinghua or Peking University, either got recruited by American tech companies or returned to China to work for the state. There was no middle ground, no space for independent thought that didn't serve either corporate or governmental interests. You sold your intelligence to the highest bidder, or you drove a cab.

The ones that did not mistake Richard Pham for Chinese thought him like a Burmese or an Indo-Chinese. Either or, the identity carries with it a connotation of a lower quality of cultural efficacy.

Burma—Myanmar—was associated with poverty, military dictatorship, ethnic violence. Indo-Chinese was a vague colonial term that suggested a mixed heritage, neither fully Asian nor fully anything else, a liminal identity that belonged nowhere. These categorizations carried with them assumptions of lesser civilization, of cultures that had failed to achieve the success of China or Japan or Korea.

Richard Pham dealt with his notions on identity in the social fabric with a kind of strangeness.

He tried on identities like costumes, discarding them when they didn't fit. He claimed to be part Mongolian for a while, playing up a warrior heritage that may or may not have existed in his bloodline. He went through a phase of identifying as "Asian-American" in the generic sense, attending cultural events and student organizations, before deciding that all of it was performative nonsense. He briefly considered claiming to be Laotian, then Thai, then just "Southeast Asian" without further specification.

Many psychologists and psychiatrists labeled him as someone with histrionic personality disorder, demonstrated by his incessant need to prove his real identity that transcends ethnic boundaries, like a dog that wants to be a wolf, defying the connotations from the facts, per se, how the cultural French put it.

The diagnosis followed him through high school counseling sessions and college mental health services. Histrionic personality disorder: excessive attention-seeking, rapid shifts in emotion, theatricality in self-presentation. The psychologists saw his identity exploration as pathological, as a refusal to accept reality. The French metaphor was cruel but apt—a dog dreaming of being a wolf, refusing to accept its domestication, yearning for a wildness that was no longer in its nature.

The way Richard Pham would detach himself from his outward identity, some of these psychologists say is telltale sign of borderline personality or multiple personality disorder.

The detachment was real. Richard could talk about "the Vietnamese" or "Asian people" as if he weren't one of them, as if he were an outside observer rather than a participant. He'd shift between personas depending on context—playing up his Asian heritage when it was advantageous, downplaying it when it wasn't, sometimes claiming to transcend race entirely as if he'd achieved some post-ethnic enlightenment.

The psychologists saw fragmentation, instability, a failure to integrate different aspects of self into a coherent whole. They prescribed medication and therapy and suggested he needed to "accept who he really was." But Richard rejected all of it. They were trying to trap him in categories that felt false, to force him into an identity box that didn't fit.

Richard Pham did not enjoy wealth or want wealth. And this made him a questionable figure in the context of capitalist power.

In a society organized around the accumulation of capital, someone who genuinely didn't care about money was incomprehensible, possibly dangerous. Richard lived minimally, spent little, accumulated nothing. He worked when he needed money for immediate survival, then stopped. He had no interest in career advancement, in retirement planning, in building equity. He seemed to view wealth as other people viewed collecting stamps—a hobby some people had, but not one that interested him.

This made him unreliable in the eyes of potential employers, but it also made him useful to someone like Emiliano. A man who didn't want wealth couldn't be bought by competitors. His loyalty, if earned, was based on something other than financial incentive.

Richard Pham was not very outgoing or friendly, and some spectators observed that Richard Pham did not chase after women. These observations prompted them to speculate on his sexuality, and that maybe he was even transgender.

He was awkward in social situations, preferred solitude, had few friends and seemed content with that arrangement. Women didn't interest him—or at least, he never pursued them in the way that young men were expected to. He didn't date, didn't flirt, didn't participate in the sexual marketplace that consumed so much of his peers' energy.

The speculation was inevitable. Gay? Asexual? Transgender? Deeply repressed? The observers tried to fit him into a category that would explain his behavior, but none of them quite worked. Richard seemed genuinely indifferent to sex and romance, viewing them as distractions from more important concerns—though what those concerns were, he never articulated clearly.

Richard Pham did not want to serve in the US military, and this made his allegiance to American nationalism questionable.

After 9/11, when military service became conflated with patriotism, when young men were expected to prove their loyalty by volunteering to fight wars in countries most couldn't locate on a map, Richard's refusal stood out. He had no moral objection to violence—that would come later—but he had no interest in dying for a country that had never fully accepted him, for a government that had tried to have him killed, for a flag that represented nothing he believed in.

The refusal marked him as suspect, as possibly subversive, as someone whose Americanness was provisional at best.

Some people felt that Richard Pham thought of himself as a black man in a Hispanic man's world, given the context of that time.

It was an odd observation, but not entirely wrong. Richard seemed to identify with the position of permanent outsider, of someone who would never be fully included regardless of their efforts. In the emerging Hispanic-dominated America, blacks were being pushed further to the margins, their concerns deprioritized, their communities neglected. Richard saw parallels to his own position—always adjacent to power but never quite part of it, always told he should be grateful for scraps while others feasted.

All these factors put together seemed to have been the perfect recipe for Richard Pham to turn to the path of monstrosity.

The psychologists had been right to be concerned, though not for the reasons they thought. Richard's identity instability, his disinterest in normal markers of success, his social isolation, his lack of nationalist loyalty—all of it made him available for radicalization. When the CIA rejected him and then tried to kill him, when he realized that no amount of assimilation would ever make him acceptably American, something in him broke or maybe finally became whole.

He did move out of the West back into the Eastern hemisphere to cooperate with Mujahideen, nomads, and other questionable characters from the perspective of Western civilization.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, in the tribal regions where central government authority meant nothing, Richard found something he'd never found in America—acceptance based not on ethnic identity but on shared opposition to Western hegemony. The Mujahideen didn't care that he was Vietnamese or looked Chinese or couldn't quite articulate who he really was. They cared that he hated the same enemies they did, that he had skills they needed, that he was willing to die for the cause.

He learned Arabic and Pashto, converted to Islam or at least claimed to, took a new name—Tensuramoto, that vaguely Japanese construct that signaled his complete rejection of his Vietnamese heritage. He grew a beard, wore traditional clothing, and became someone else entirely.

Richard Pham's strange ways worked very well for Emiliano's ambitions.

From Emiliano's perspective, Richard was perfect. His strangeness kept him isolated from normal social networks, meaning he couldn't be compromised by personal relationships. His lack of interest in wealth meant he worked for ideology rather than money, which made him more reliable than mercenaries. His technical skills and understanding of intelligence networks were invaluable. And his position in the Eastern hemisphere, embedded with extremist organizations, gave Emiliano access to networks and capabilities that no other American criminal enterprise possessed.

Richard was less competition for capital, women and prestige, while serving as a reliable gateway to the East as a data broker and commercial spy.

He didn't want the things that other men wanted, which meant Emiliano never had to worry about Richard trying to take over, trying to seduce his women, trying to build a rival empire. Richard was content to operate in the shadows, moving information and products, connecting networks that would never have connected otherwise. He was a bridge between worlds, a translator not just of languages but of entire civilizations.

As a data broker, Richard sold information to the highest bidder—or sometimes just to whoever he thought should have it, following logic that only he understood. Corporate secrets, government intelligence, terrorist plans, cartel operations—all of it flowed through Richard's networks, was sorted and categorized and sold or shared according to his inscrutable criteria.

As a commercial spy, Richard infiltrated organizations, stole technologies, identified opportunities and threats. His lack of obvious loyalty to anyone made him perfect for the work. No one could predict his allegiances because he had none beyond his strange personal code.

Emiliano, being the multi-faceted business magnate that he was destined to be, needed eyes and ears in every corner of his empire in inheritance, as he rose to power.

The empire that Emiliano was building would span continents, would operate in legal and illegal markets, would require coordination across cultures and languages and legal systems that had nothing in common. He needed people embedded everywhere—in corporate boardrooms and criminal networks, in government agencies and terrorist cells, in legitimate businesses and black markets.

Richard Pham, that strange boy who'd been called a faggot in high school and couldn't pass physics and never quite figured out who he was supposed to be, became one of Emiliano's most valuable assets. Not because he was loyal in the conventional sense—his loyalties shifted according to logic that remained opaque even to Emiliano—but because his position and capabilities were irreplaceable.

When Emiliano needed to move product through Central Asia, Richard made the connections. When intelligence was needed on Chinese corporate strategies, Richard provided it. When competitors needed to be monitored or eliminated in the Eastern hemisphere, Richard made it happen.

The relationship was symbiotic in its way. Emiliano provided Richard with purpose, with resources, with a place in a grand design that transcended the petty nationalism and ethnic categories that Richard had always rejected. Richard provided Emiliano with reach, with capabilities, with access to networks that would have been impossible for a Florida-based Hispanic criminal to penetrate alone.

They were both outsiders in their own ways—Emiliano marked from birth by power that set him apart, Richard rendered alien by his refusal to accept any identity that was offered to him. And in that shared alienation, they found a working relationship that would help reshape the world.

The torment that both men inflicted and endured, the violence they orchestrated, the systems they corrupted—all of it was building toward something larger than themselves. They were instruments of transformation, agents of a change that was already in motion when they were born but which they accelerated and directed according to their visions.

Richard Pham would eventually die violently, killed by cartel members on Emiliano's orders when he became too dangerous, too unpredictable, too likely to compromise the empire. But before that end, he would serve his purpose, would help build the networks that would persist long after both men were gone.

And in the years when Emiliano was rising to power, when America was hispanicizing and the old order was crumbling and new possibilities were opening up for those willing to seize them, Richard Pham—that strange, alienated boy who'd tried to become something beyond ethnic categories—was there in the background, moving information and products and money across borders, bridging East and West, serving purposes he barely understood in service of an empire he'd helped create.

Such were the associates of Emiliano in his rise to power. Strange men with stranger motivations, united not by friendship or ideology but by their shared willingness to do what others wouldn't, to become what others couldn't, to participate in the torment and transformation of an entire civilization.

The romantics of Florida, after all, were never just about beauty and passion. They were about the darkness underneath, the violence that made beauty possible, the torment that preceded and enabled every transformation.

And Richard Pham, for all his strangeness, understood that truth better than most.

## Emiliano's Natural Romanticism

With people such as Richard Pham, Emiliano respected Richard's utility as a cog in his imperial machine. However, on other matters, such as cultural matters, Richard Pham became such a laughingstock that even Emiliano, the good-humored and non-condescending man he was, couldn't help but crack jokes about to his colleagues from time to time.

"You should have seen the email he sent me," Emiliano said once, over cigars and whiskey with Joseph Clayton and his consortium of wives. They were on the terrace of his penthouse, overlooking Tampa Bay, the city lights twinkling like fallen stars. "He wrote an entire manifesto about how Western romance is a capitalist construct designed to commodify human connection. Twelve pages. Single-spaced."

Joseph laughed, smoke curling from his lips. "Did he cite sources?"

"Of course he did. Marx, Foucault, some militant Islamic scholar I'd never heard of. The man has a PhD from the school of making everything unnecessarily complicated."

"Does he even have a girlfriend?" one of Joseph's wives asked—Maryann, the first one, the one who still sometimes forgot she was part of a plural marriage.

"Richard?" Emiliano shook his head, grinning. "Richard thinks romance is a Western disease. He told me once that if he ever felt attracted to someone, he'd meditate until the feeling passed. Said desire was a form of colonial mindset."

They all laughed at that, though not cruelly. Richard was useful, invaluable even, but his complete inability to understand basic human connection made him an object of gentle mockery among those who knew him. He could orchestrate terrorist attacks and broker international arms deals, but the concept of simply liking another person romantically seemed beyond his comprehension.

Emiliano didn't mind Richard's peculiarities. In fact, they made Richard more predictable in some ways. A man who wanted nothing—no women, no wealth, no recognition—was easier to work with than someone driven by the messy complications of human desire.

But Emiliano himself was not like Richard. Could never be like Richard.

Emiliano had many lovers, as stated before in his first part.

The list was extensive, varied, international. Models from Brazil, businesswomen from New York, artists from Paris, intellectuals from Buenos Aires. Some relationships lasted years, others barely a night. Some were transactional, others had genuine affection mixed into the arrangement. Emiliano moved through the world of romance with the same instinctive understanding he brought to business—reading people, knowing what they wanted, giving it to them or withholding it according to what served his purposes.

But it was more than calculation. There was something in Emiliano that genuinely appreciated beauty, that responded to connection, that felt the pull of attraction as something almost sacred. Even as he used romance as a tool, as a means of building alliances and gathering intelligence and rewarding loyalty, there was real feeling underneath. He was a romantic in the truest sense—someone who believed that passion mattered, that desire was a form of truth, that the connection between people was where life became worth living.

Who knows with the greatness of Emiliano? Perhaps even if Emiliano was brought up under autocratic ruling, denied privileges, deprived of rights, he would still have been just as romantic and successful in his inevitable rise to power.

It was a question Emiliano sometimes pondered late at night, when the drugs had worn off and the women had gone home and he was alone with his thoughts. What if he'd been born in Cuba under Castro? In China during the Cultural Revolution? In some desperate dictatorship where his fire would have been stamped out before it could fully ignite?

He liked to think he would have found a way. That the power in his blood was not just a product of circumstances but something essential, inevitable, that would have manifested regardless of context. That even in chains, even under surveillance, even with every advantage stripped away, he would have risen. Because that's what greatness did—it emerged, it found expression, it refused to be contained.

The romanticism would have been there too. Maybe expressed differently, maybe more carefully hidden, but present nonetheless. Because Emiliano's romantic nature wasn't learned behavior or cultural conditioning. It was as fundamental to him as the heat that had pulsed from his infant skin, as intrinsic as the darkness he'd cultivated after his first beating.

One person that proved to be a template for the romanticism of Emiliano that helped him woo the world over before practically conquering a large swath of it, through empire, was Alejandros Caballicci.

Alejandros. Even the name sounded romantic, rolled off the tongue like poetry. Emiliano had known him in high school, though they'd never been close friends. Alejandros had existed in a different social sphere—not better or worse, just different. He was the son of an Italian-Argentine diplomat, had lived in five countries before turning sixteen, spoke four languages fluently, and carried himself with an ease that suggested he'd never encountered a situation he couldn't handle.

During high school, Emiliano had observed Alejandros' greatness as an agent of virility through Alejandros' interactions with Samantha Lucianos.

Samantha Lucianos was legendary in her own right. She came from old Tampa money, her family's wealth built on phosphate mining and citrus groves and real estate speculation that had paid off spectacularly. She was beautiful in that effortless way that came from good genes and better grooming—tall, dark-haired, with eyes that could freeze or ignite depending on her mood. She was captain of the volleyball team, editor of the school newspaper, destined for an Ivy League education and a life of continued privilege.

The dynamic duo. From two worlds apart, two very different families, yet... yet love at first sight.

It had happened at a school assembly sophomore year. Alejandros had transferred in mid-semester, was being introduced to the student body by the principal. Samantha had been sitting three rows from the front, half-paying attention, when Alejandros walked onto the stage. Their eyes met across the auditorium, and something visible passed between them—a recognition, a knowing, an instant certainty that defied logic.

Emiliano had been sitting two seats away from Samantha and had seen it happen. Had watched her posture change, her breathing shift, her entire being reorient toward this stranger on the stage. And when he'd glanced at Alejandros, he'd seen the same thing—a laser focus, an immediate claiming, a decision made in the space between heartbeats.

They'd been together by the end of that day. Together in the sense that mattered, that transcended official boyfriend-girlfriend labels. They moved through the school like a unit, finishing each other's sentences, their bodies always angled toward each other even when they were in separate conversations. It was magnetic, almost uncomfortable to watch because it was so intense, so complete.

Emiliano, of course, had also experienced love at first sight.

With Brittany Cluetrick, though that had ended in betrayal and violence. With a girl named Isabella in middle school who'd moved away before anything could develop. With others over the years—that instant recognition, that pull of attraction so strong it felt chemical, biological, ordained by forces beyond conscious choice.

Furthermore, he capitalized on those experiences to be with the ones he so loved.

When Emiliano felt that pull, he acted on it. No hesitation, no second-guessing, no waiting to see if the feeling would pass or be reciprocated. He approached, he spoke, he made his interest clear. Sometimes it worked spectacularly. Sometimes it failed and he moved on. But he never let the moment pass without acknowledgment, never denied the feeling or pretended it didn't exist.

This was one area where Emiliano's romanticism and his ruthlessness were indistinguishable. He pursued what he wanted with the same intensity he brought to building his empire. Love at first sight was real to him, was a signal that shouldn't be ignored, was an opportunity that demanded immediate action.

But his observations on Alejandros proved valuable, at the time, and also at a later date.

What Emiliano had noticed, watching Alejandros and Samantha over the years, was the efficiency of their connection. They never fought publicly, never had dramatic breakups and reconciliations, never engaged in the messy emotional theatrics that characterized most high school relationships. Their romance operated like a well-tuned machine—smooth, predictable, effective.

Alejandros knew exactly how to make Samantha happy. Flowers on the right occasions, thoughtful gifts that demonstrated he was paying attention, public displays of affection that were romantic without being crude. He remembered details she mentioned in passing, anticipated her needs before she articulated them, calibrated his behavior to maintain the perfect balance between devotion and independence.

Samantha, in turn, supported Alejandros perfectly. She attended his soccer games, helped him navigate the social complexities of American high school, made him look good in front of her wealthy family, never demanded more than he could reasonably give.

It was love, certainly. But it was also performance, choreography, a dance where both partners knew their steps and executed them flawlessly.

During his rise to power, Emiliano experienced less of the love at first sight. There was still the romanticism, but it was not as driven and warm and outgoing. Instead, it had become scripted.

As Emiliano's empire grew, as his time became more valuable and his exposure to risk increased, spontaneous romance became a luxury he couldn't afford. Every relationship had to be vetted, every lover had to be assessed for security risks, every moment of passion had to be scheduled around the demands of running a criminal organization that spanned continents.

The warmth was still there—Emiliano couldn't help that, couldn't turn off the part of him that responded to beauty and connection. But it was channeled, controlled, expressed in ways that served his purposes rather than disrupting them.

In the image of the dynamic duo, Alejandros Caballicci and Samantha Lucianos. Efficient.

Emiliano began modeling his romantic relationships on what he'd observed in high school. He identified what each woman wanted and provided it with the same precision Alejandros had shown. Flowers, jewelry, attention, validation, excitement, security—whatever it was, Emiliano delivered it efficiently, professionally, in ways that maximized satisfaction while minimizing complications.

He scheduled dates with the same attention to detail he brought to business meetings. He remembered birthdays and preferences and personal histories not out of organic affection but because he'd trained himself to remember, because it was part of the performance that maintained the relationship.

The sex was still passionate, still intense, but it too became choreographed over time. He learned what worked, what each woman responded to, and he delivered it consistently. There was pleasure in that consistency, in the mastery of technique, in becoming so skilled at reading and responding to desire that the outcome was nearly guaranteed.

Even a romantic such as Emiliano knew a thing or two about the superiority that machines can bring.

This was the paradox at the heart of Emiliano's nature. He was genuinely romantic—he believed in love, in passion, in the transformative power of connection. But he was also ruthlessly practical, willing to mechanize and optimize even the most intimate aspects of human experience if it served his larger purposes.

Where Richard Pham rejected romance entirely, viewing it as a Western disease or capitalist construct, Emiliano embraced it but on his own terms. Romance was real, was valuable, was worth pursuing. But it could also be engineered, optimized, made more efficient through careful observation and systematic application of proven techniques.

The dynamic duo had shown him that. Alejandros and Samantha had proved that romance didn't have to be chaotic, didn't have to disrupt everything else in life, could instead be integrated seamlessly into a larger plan. Their relationship had lasted through high school, through college at different universities, through the early years of their careers. They'd eventually married in a ceremony that was covered by society magazines, settled into a life of tasteful wealth and mutual support.

Emiliano had attended the wedding, had watched Alejandros and Samantha exchange vows with the same smooth certainty they'd brought to everything else. He'd felt something watching them—not envy exactly, but a kind of recognition. They'd figured out how to have romance and stability, passion and predictability, love and efficiency.

That was what Emiliano wanted for himself. Not the suburban domesticity that Alejandros and Samantha had chosen, but the principle underneath—the idea that romance could be mastered, that passion could be systematized, that even the most intense human connections could be engineered to serve rather than disrupt one's larger goals.

So he studied them, internalized their lessons, and applied them systematically across his growing empire of relationships.

With Maria, his on-again-off-again lover who managed his Miami operations, he replicated the supportive partnership dynamic that Samantha had provided Alejandros. She got gifts and attention and public recognition; he got loyalty and discretion and professional competence.

With Yuki, the Japanese businesswoman who facilitated his Asian expansion, he borrowed Alejandros's technique of remembering small details and making grand gestures at strategic moments. She felt seen, valued, special; he got access to networks and markets that would have been closed to him otherwise.

With dozens of others—some serious, most casual, all carefully managed—Emiliano applied the template he'd learned watching the dynamic duo. Romance as performance, passion as technique, love as a system that could be optimized for maximum efficiency.

And it worked. It worked spectacularly.

Women fell in love with him, stayed loyal to him, served his empire while believing they were part of something romantic and meaningful. And they were—Emiliano's feelings were real, his affection genuine, his pleasure in their company authentic. But it was all channeled, all directed, all made to serve the larger purpose of building and maintaining his power.

Richard Pham could mock Western romance all he wanted from his extremist safe houses in Pakistan. Richard could write twelve-page manifestos about the commodification of desire and the colonial nature of attraction. But Richard would die alone and unmourned, while Emiliano would be surrounded by lovers and allies, by people who'd been drawn to him through the very romantic mechanisms Richard rejected.

The natural romanticism of Emiliano—that instinctive warmth, that genuine capacity for passion, that real appreciation for beauty and connection—had been refined through observation and practice into something more powerful than spontaneous feeling alone could ever be.

He was still a romantic. Would always be a romantic. That was in his blood, in the fire that had pulsed through him since birth, in the very essence of what made him Emiliano Santiago Reyes.

But he was also a machine, or had learned to operate like one when necessary. And in the synthesis of these two aspects—the passionate romantic and the efficient operator—Emiliano had found the key to wooing and conquering the world.

Alejandros Caballicci probably never knew the role he'd played in shaping the most powerful criminal empire in American history. He and Samantha lived their tasteful lives, raised their tasteful children, attended their tasteful social events, completely unaware that their high school romance had served as a template for something much darker and more ambitious.

But Emiliano remembered. Emiliano had watched and learned and applied those lessons across decades of romantic conquest and commercial domination.

Such utter romantics of Florida, they all were. Alejandros with his smooth continental charm, Samantha with her old-money elegance, Emiliano with his fire and darkness and impossible ambitions.

Of fiction and fantasia, these lives they lived. The dynamic duo in their perfect partnership, the lonely data broker in his desert compounds, the supreme leader building his empire one calculated romance at a time.

And beneath it all, beneath the performances and the systems and the carefully calibrated emotions, there was still something real. Still genuine feeling, authentic connection, true passion.

Emiliano had mechanized romance, had made it efficient and systematic and subordinate to his larger goals.

But he'd never stopped being a romantic.

And that combination—of authentic feeling and systematic execution, of real passion and calculated performance—was what made him unstoppable.

Richard Pham would laugh at all of it, would write another manifesto about false consciousness and capitalist alienation.

But Emiliano would keep winning, keep wooing, keep conquering.

Because even a machine, properly calibrated, could embody more romance than a thousand isolated intellectuals rejecting connection in the name of ideological purity.

And Emiliano, that natural romantic who'd learned to love with the efficiency of the dynamic duo, would continue his rise to power through a world that still, despite everything, responded to the oldest human drives—desire, connection, the longing to be seen and known and chosen by someone who seemed to understand you perfectly.

Even if that understanding was, in part, a beautiful and carefully maintained illusion.

Even if the romance was scripted.

Even if the passion had been optimized for efficiency.

It was still real.

And it still worked.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, standing on his terrace with his cigar and his whiskey and his memories of Alejandros and Samantha and all the lovers he'd had since, smiled at the perfection of it all.

The torment and the romance. The calculation and the feeling. The machine and the passionate heart.

All of it working together, all of it serving his inevitable rise to power.

Such was the natural romanticism of Emiliano.

Efficient. Beautiful. Unstoppable.

## Emiliano The Humanitarian

There is seldom a true humanitarian that does not understand the terrible gravity that inhumanity brings.

The understanding comes not from theory or philosophy, not from books or lectures or moral instruction, but from witnessing cruelty firsthand. From seeing what humans do to each other when they believe no one is watching, when they believe their actions carry no consequences, when they've convinced themselves that the person they're hurting isn't fully human and therefore doesn't fully count.

Emiliano had seen plenty of cruelty. Had inflicted plenty himself. He'd ordered beatings and murders, had destroyed lives with the casual indifference of someone swatting a fly, had built an empire on the suffering of addicts and the corruption of institutions. He was not squeamish about violence, did not pretend that power could be accumulated without blood.

But there was a difference, he believed, between strategic violence and mindless cruelty. Between harm that served a purpose and harm inflicted simply because someone enjoyed inflicting it. Between breaking people who threatened your empire and breaking people who'd done nothing except exist in a way that made small-minded individuals uncomfortable.

One of Emiliano's most memorable sightings was on one occasion when he was 27. He was a made man, an established business magnate rivaling the neo-Carnegies and post-Rockefellers at that time.

It was summer in Tampa, the air thick and wet like breathing through a warm towel. Emiliano had been walking through Ybor City—partly for pleasure, partly for business, checking on one of his clubs that operated in a converted cigar factory. He'd been alone, which was rare, having dismissed his security for the evening because sometimes he needed to move through the world without an entourage, needed to remember what it felt like to be just another person on the street.

He'd been thinking about nothing in particular, enjoying the music spilling from open doors, the smell of Cuban coffee and fried plantains, the rhythm of Spanish and English mixing in conversations around him. This was his city now, in ways that went beyond ownership or control. This was the world he'd helped create, the Hispanicization made manifest in architecture and language and the very texture of street life.

That's when he'd seen it.

Emiliano saw Esteban Hernandez jump in to defend his husband, Joshua Polanski, being attacked by teenagers for being homosexual.

There were four of them—boys really, maybe sixteen or seventeen, wearing the kind of athletic gear and expensive sneakers that marked them as middle-class kids slumming it in Ybor, looking for trouble because they were bored and cruel and hadn't yet learned that actions had consequences.

They'd surrounded Joshua outside a bar, had been calling him names—"faggot" and "queer" and worse things, said with the particular viciousness that teenagers could muster when they were performing masculinity for each other. Joshua had been trying to ignore them, to walk away, but they'd followed him, escalating from words to shoving.

That's when Esteban had emerged from the bar.

Esteban was smaller than Joshua, more slender, the kind of build that didn't suggest physical prowess. But he'd moved without hesitation, putting himself between his husband and the teenagers, his voice sharp and unafraid.

"Touch him again and see what happens."

The teenagers had laughed. One of them had pushed Esteban, hard enough to make him stumble backward. Another had grabbed Joshua's shirt, twisting it, getting ready to throw a punch.

And Esteban had exploded.

There was no other word for it. He'd launched himself at the teenager holding Joshua, moving with a speed and ferocity that caught everyone off guard. He wasn't trained, wasn't skilled, but he was absolutely committed to the violence, fighting with the desperate intensity of someone defending what mattered most in the world.

He got in a few good hits before the other teenagers swarmed him. Then it became four on one, and the outcome was inevitable. They beat Esteban down, kicking him while he was on the ground, laughing while they did it.

Joshua tried to pull them off, but one of the teenagers punched him in the face, dropping him.

That's when Emiliano intervened.

He moved quickly, efficiently, without announcement. Grabbed the first teenager by the back of his neck and slammed his face into the brick wall hard enough to break his nose. Kicked the second one's knee sideways, felt it pop, heard the scream. The third one turned to face him and Emiliano punched him in the throat, a precise strike that dropped him gasping to the pavement.

The fourth one, the smart one, ran.

The whole thing took maybe ten seconds. Then it was over, and Emiliano was standing over three writhing teenagers while Esteban and Joshua slowly picked themselves up, bleeding and dazed.

Esteban recognized him immediately. "Mr. Reyes."

"Esteban. Joshua." Emiliano looked at the teenagers, then back at the couple. "Are you both alright?"

"We're fine," Joshua said, though his eye was already swelling shut. "Thank you."

Emiliano nodded. Then he looked down at the teenagers, making sure they could see his face, memorize it. "You know who I am?"

Two of them nodded, terror replacing bravado. The third was still gasping for air, couldn't respond.

"Good. Then you understand what happens if I ever see you again. What happens if you ever touch anyone in this neighborhood again. What happens if you even think about what you did here tonight without feeling ashamed."

He let that sink in, then made a phone call. Within minutes, his security arrived. He had them drive the teenagers to the hospital—their parents would ask questions, but the story would be that they'd been jumped by someone else, somewhere else, and if they told the truth they'd face consequences that would make tonight's beating seem merciful.

Then he'd taken Esteban and Joshua to get cleaned up, had his personal doctor check them over, had made sure they were actually okay.

They'd sat in his penthouse afterward, drinking expensive whiskey that Emiliano poured for them personally, looking out over the city lights.

"You didn't have to do that," Esteban said quietly. "We can handle ourselves."

"I saw you handling yourself," Emiliano replied. "You fought well. Bravely."

"But we would have lost."

"Yes. Four against two, with surprise on their side. You would have lost." Emiliano sipped his whiskey. "But you fought anyway. You put yourself between them and Joshua without hesitation. That's what I saw. That's what mattered."

Despite Emiliano's principle way of growing up, in the way of romanticism but mostly the proper kind, the kind with rules. There are rules to everything, Emiliano was taught.

His mother had drilled this into him from childhood. Romance was beautiful, passion was sacred, but both existed within frameworks of proper conduct. You pursued women respectfully, not aggressively. You declared your intentions honestly, not through manipulation. You treated lovers with dignity, even when the relationship ended. You protected those who couldn't protect themselves. You honored commitments. You maintained boundaries.

The rules weren't arbitrary. They existed to channel powerful forces—desire, aggression, ambition—into forms that didn't destroy everything they touched. His father had shown him this through example, had been passionate but never violent toward Maria, had been ambitious but never ruthless toward family, had understood that strength without discipline was just chaos.

Even as Emiliano built his empire, even as he broke countless laws and corrupted countless institutions, he maintained his own internal code. His own rules about what was acceptable and what crossed lines that shouldn't be crossed.

But when Emiliano saw Esteban Hernandez defend his husband with such passion and strength, Emiliano was reminded of his obligation to be a humanitarian to everyone worthy of it, even as he was forced to make concessions here and there in his ongoing rise to power.

Esteban and Joshua had been loyal to him for years. They ran his clubs efficiently, discreetly, profitably. They managed the prostitution operations without cruelty, treated the women who worked for them fairly—or as fairly as possible in that business. They asked for nothing beyond their agreed compensation, never tried to skim or scheme or build their own rival operations.

But more than that, they'd shown him something that night. Esteban's willingness to fight impossible odds to protect Joshua. Joshua's attempt to pull the teenagers off Esteban even after being punched. The way they'd helped each other up afterward, checking each other for injuries before worrying about themselves.

That was real. That was the kind of connection that couldn't be faked or performed or optimized for efficiency. That was what all his mechanized romanticism was trying to approximate—the genuine thing, the bond so strong that self-preservation became secondary to protecting the other person.

Emiliano had built an empire on exploiting human weakness. Addiction, greed, lust, fear—he'd weaponized all of it, had turned natural human drives into profit streams. He'd made moral concessions constantly, had accepted that you couldn't accumulate power without getting blood on your hands, had made peace with being a monster in service of larger goals.

But he'd never lost sight of what was worth protecting. What deserved to be defended, even when defending it served no strategic purpose, generated no profit, advanced no agenda.

"I'm going to tell you something," Emiliano said to them that night, as they sat in his penthouse with their injuries tended and their whiskey glasses refilled. "Something I don't tell many people."

They waited, attentive.

"When I was seventeen, I was beaten by four men. Left on the sidewalk, bleeding, with a concussion and broken ribs. They did it because I'd dated a white girl, because I'd forgotten my place, because people like me weren't supposed to reach for things that belonged to people like them."

Esteban and Joshua exchanged glances. They'd heard rumors, but Emiliano rarely spoke about it directly.

"I remember lying there, half-conscious, tasting blood, thinking that this was what the world really was. Not the romance and beauty and possibility I'd believed in. Just power and cruelty and people hurting other people because they could."

He paused, looking out at the city.

"I built everything I have on that understanding. On accepting that the world is cruel, that power matters more than justice, that nice guys finish last and ruthless ones win. I became what I needed to become to make sure I'd never be powerless again."

"But?" Joshua prompted quietly.

"But tonight, watching Esteban fight to protect you, I remembered something else. I remembered that cruelty isn't strength. That there's a difference between being powerful and being a bully. That the teenagers who attacked you are weak, not strong. That the men who beat me were cowards, not warriors."

Emiliano turned to face them directly.

"You both work for me. You know what I do, what I am. You've seen the violence, the corruption, the lives destroyed. And you might wonder if there's any difference between me and those teenagers, between my empire and their cruelty."

"There is a difference," Esteban said firmly.

"Is there? I've had people killed. I've destroyed families with drugs. I've corrupted police and politicians. I've built wealth on suffering."

"Yes," Joshua said. "But you have rules. You have lines you won't cross. You protect people who work for you. You defended us tonight when you didn't have to, when it served no business purpose."

"Exactly," Emiliano said. "I have rules. And one of those rules is that random cruelty, violence inflicted just because someone is different, hatred directed at people for existing—that's beneath me. That's beneath anyone who wants to claim they're building something, creating something, rather than just destroying for the sake of destruction."

He refilled their glasses one more time.

"I'm not a good man. I know what I am. But I can still recognize goodness when I see it, can still defend it when it's threatened, can still maintain some small connection to the humanity I've had to compromise in so many other areas."

"You're more human than you think," Esteban said softly.

Emiliano smiled, though there was sadness in it. "Maybe. Or maybe I'm just a monster with standards. But tonight, those standards mattered. Tonight, seeing you fight for Joshua reminded me why I have them."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, three men who'd all been beaten for different reasons, who'd all survived, who'd all found ways to build lives in a world that hadn't wanted them to succeed.

"The teenagers," Joshua asked eventually. "What will happen to them?"

"Nothing permanent. Broken bones heal. Fear fades. But they'll remember tonight for the rest of their lives. They'll remember that cruelty has consequences, that victims sometimes fight back, that the world isn't always safe for bullies."

"Will they learn from it?"

Emiliano shrugged. "Some will. Some won't. But at least they'll remember."

In the years that followed, Emiliano would fund LGBTQ community centers, would ensure his clubs were safe spaces where harassment wasn't tolerated, would make it known that anyone working in his organization who engaged in discrimination faced immediate termination at best, worse consequences at worst. He did this quietly, without publicity, because humanitarian gestures that served public relations purposes weren't truly humanitarian—they were just another form of branding.

He'd continue making terrible moral concessions in other areas. Would continue destroying lives with drugs, corrupting institutions, eliminating competitors with extreme prejudice. The empire required these things, and Emiliano never pretended otherwise.

But within his empire, certain rules held. Certain lines weren't crossed. Certain people were protected, not because protecting them generated profit but because some things mattered beyond calculation.

Esteban and Joshua remained loyal until the end, running his operations with competence and discretion, never forgetting the night their boss had intervened on their behalf. They told the story sometimes, to trusted associates, about how Emiliano Santiago Reyes had brutalized four teenagers for attacking them, had sat with them afterward and shared his own history of being victimized, had articulated a philosophy of power that recognized the difference between strength and cruelty.

And those who heard the story understood something important about the man who controlled so much of their world—that he was capable of terrible things, yes, but also capable of defending the defenseless, of maintaining standards in a lawless enterprise, of being humanitarian even while acknowledging he was also monstrous.

There is seldom a true humanitarian that does not understand the terrible gravity that inhumanity brings.

Emiliano understood it deeply, viscerally, from personal experience. Had felt inhumanity directed at him, had internalized its lessons, had built an empire partly as protection against ever experiencing it again.

But understanding inhumanity's gravity meant recognizing it when he saw it, opposing it when he could, maintaining some connection to the humanity that his rise to power had required him to compromise in so many other ways.

He was Emiliano Santiago Reyes—drug lord, murderer, corrupter of institutions, builder of empires.

But he was also a humanitarian, in his way.

A monster with standards.

A romantic who understood rules.

A man who'd been beaten for reaching above his station and who'd never forgotten what that felt like, who'd vowed not just to gain power but to use it sometimes—not always, not even often, but sometimes—to defend others from experiencing the same cruelty.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these people who contained multitudes, who were capable of both terrible darkness and unexpected light.

Of fiction and fantasia, these lives that defied simple categorization, that were simultaneously monstrous and humanitarian, cruel and protective, strategic and emotional.

And in the torment and triumph that characterized Emiliano's rise to power, moments like the one with Esteban and Joshua stood out—reminders that power could be used for protection as well as exploitation, that rules mattered even in lawless enterprises, that humanity could persist even in monsters.

The teenagers healed. Their fear eventually faded to memory, then to story, then to cautionary tale they told to explain why they never engaged in certain behaviors anymore.

Esteban and Joshua continued their work, their loyalty deepened by gratitude and respect.

And Emiliano continued building his empire, making his concessions, accumulating his power.

But he never forgot what he'd seen that night—the passion and strength with which Esteban had defended Joshua, the reminder of what real connection looked like, the obligation he felt to protect it when possible even while exploiting so much else.

Such was Emiliano the Humanitarian.

Complicated. Contradictory. Capable of both terrible cruelty and unexpected mercy.

A man who understood the gravity that inhumanity brings.

And who chose, sometimes, to fight against it.

Even as he embodied it in so many other ways.

## Emiliano's Superior Form

There are criticisms of all forms. Too skinny gets called anorexic. Mesomorphs get called fat. Endomorphs get called obesity.

The human compulsion to critique, to tear down, to find fault in everything—it was universal, inescapable. No matter what shape you took, what path you chose, what philosophy you embodied, there would always be voices declaring you wrong, insufficient, worthy of contempt. The skinny were too weak. The muscular were compensating. The heavy were undisciplined. Everyone had an opinion about how everyone else should exist, and those opinions were offered freely, viciously, without regard for whether they were solicited or accurate.

Emiliano's form of ultimate romanticism also could not escape the petty critiques of mankind.

They called him too emotional, too passionate, too driven by feelings rather than logic. They said his romanticism was a weakness, a liability, a character flaw that would inevitably destroy him. The cold rationalists in their boardrooms and think tanks looked at Emiliano's warmth with suspicion, his compassion with contempt, his passion with disdain. Real power, they insisted, came from calculation and emotional detachment, from treating people as resources and relationships as transactions.

But one sole but unquestionable aspect about Emiliano's form stood out that made critics detested him even more. He won it all.

That was the thing that galled them most. Not that Emiliano was romantic, but that his romanticism worked. Not that he led with passion, but that his passion generated loyalty and devotion that cold rationality never could. Not that he maintained humanitarian principles, but that those principles somehow didn't prevent him from accumulating more power than the supposedly superior rationalists had ever dreamed of achieving.

He won the women they couldn't get. He built the empire they couldn't imagine. He commanded loyalty they couldn't purchase. He transformed society in ways they couldn't engineer. And he did it all while maintaining the romantic form they'd dismissed as inferior, as naive, as doomed to failure.

The critics whispered to each other how Emiliano's compassion and passion would be his ultimate downfall. But they spectated as Emiliano's enemies were obliterated in systematic fashion, but every domino that falls, red and petrifying rage.

They'd predicted his collapse for decades. "Wait until he faces real opposition," they'd said. "Wait until his enemies coordinate against him." "Wait until his romantic ideals clash with hard reality." "Wait until someone more ruthless comes along."

But the enemies never prevailed. They fell one after another, destroyed not despite Emiliano's romantic form but because of it. His passion inspired soldiers who fought harder than mercenaries. His compassion created networks of loyalty that mere money couldn't buy. His romanticism made people believe in him, want to serve him, sacrifice for him in ways that cold rationalists could never inspire.

And when the dominoes fell—when competitors were eliminated, when obstacles were removed, when threats were neutralized—it wasn't done with detached efficiency. It was done with rage, with fury, with the fire that had always burned in Emiliano's blood. Red and petrifying rage that left no doubt about what happened to those who threatened his empire, his people, his vision.

The rationalists had thought emotion was weakness. Emiliano proved that properly channeled emotion was the most powerful weapon of all.

America was going through cultural transitions, and cooler heads were not prevailing. Instead, the cooler heads became immobilized by their calm reasoning, thinking when they could be doing.

The technocrats and academics, the policy wonks and corporate executives—all the people who prided themselves on rationality, on evidence-based decision-making, on careful analysis—they were paralyzed. Every decision required committees, studies, risk assessments, stakeholder consultations. By the time they'd analyzed a situation thoroughly enough to act, the situation had changed and they needed to start the analysis over.

The cooler heads outsourced their corporations to the other side of the planet, and became sedentary, complacent in their status.

They'd been so rational, so logical. Labor was cheaper in Asia, therefore move manufacturing there. Why maintain American production capacity when you could maximize short-term profits through outsourcing? The spreadsheets made sense. The quarterly reports looked good. And by the time they realized they'd hollowed out the industrial base of their own country, had created dependencies on foreign supply chains, had gutted communities and destroyed the working class that had been their consumer base, it was too late to reverse course.

They'd become fat and lazy on their own success, convinced that their rationality made them invincible, that their superior intelligence would always find solutions to problems their own policies created.

One big factor was the cooler heads, the rationalists per se, were losing it against the A.I. ecosystems that were first hailed as Western civilization's new Manifest Destiny to a deterioration of norms so consequential that feudalism had become normalized.

The artificial intelligence revolution had been supposed to usher in a new era of prosperity and progress. The rationalists had embraced it enthusiastically, had invested billions, had promised that automation would free humanity from drudgery and create unprecedented wealth.

Instead, it had concentrated wealth even further, had eliminated millions of jobs without creating equivalent new opportunities, had given a tiny technological elite god-like power over everyone else. The promised AI utopia had become a neo-feudal nightmare where a few tech barons controlled the algorithms that controlled everything else, where everyone else scrambled for scraps in gig economies and platform capitalism that resembled medieval serfdom more than modern employment.

The rationalists had built their own obsolescence, had created systems that didn't need them, had automated away the middle-class expertise that had been their power base. And they were too committed to their rational worldview to admit that their rational policies had produced irrational, catastrophic outcomes.

The destitute, the disenfranchised, all these marginalized groups came to view Emiliano as the rightful one to push forward with the agenda.

Because Emiliano offered something the rationalists couldn't: passion, vision, a sense that someone actually cared about their suffering rather than viewing it as an acceptable externality in some economic model.

Emiliano spoke from compassion. Emiliano did not espouse hate. Emiliano was confident.

He spoke to people like they were human beings rather than data points. He acknowledged their pain rather than explaining why their pain was economically necessary. He promised not just prosperity but dignity, not just wealth but belonging, not just survival but meaning.

And he was confident in a way that inspired confidence in others. Not the false bravado of politicians reading from teleprompters, not the nervous self-aggrandizement of tech CEOs who knew their empires were built on sand, but genuine confidence that came from knowing who he was, what he wanted, and how to achieve it.

These traits became rarer by the day during America's cultural transitions. The typical leaders were opaque, spoke in circles, invited mass hysteria, and in some regions of the United States, were even getting driven out by Mujahideen and Vietcong affiliates from America's previous wars.

The political class had become hollow, performative, incapable of inspiring genuine loyalty or belief. They spoke in focus-grouped phrases designed not to communicate but to avoid offense. They stood for nothing except their own continued power. They managed crises rather than solving them, temporized rather than leading, and wondered why nobody trusted them anymore.

And in the vacuum of their failure, strange things were happening. Veterans of America's foreign wars—Mujahideen who'd been trained and funded by the CIA in Afghanistan, Vietcong sympathizers who'd never forgotten or forgiven—were returning with skills and grudges. In some regions, particularly in areas where federal authority had collapsed, they were establishing their own zones of control, settling old scores, proving that America's chickens were finally coming home to roost.

Emiliano was a natural, but his perfection had to be maintained.

He understood that his romantic form, his passionate leadership, his humanitarian impulses—all of it required careful cultivation. Romanticism without discipline became chaos. Passion without control became destructive. Compassion without boundaries became weakness that enemies would exploit.

One figure he used as a counterexample to his ambitions was Richard Pham.

Richard was everything Emiliano was careful not to become—alienated, isolated, unable to channel his intelligence and intensity into productive forms, capable of self-destructive actions that served no strategic purpose.

Emiliano, given his ambition, had to tread through dark waters and walk around eggshells in America's factionalism. Besides from the neo-Carnegies and post-Rockefellers, Emiliano was also not that aligned with the Jewish syndicates nor the Arab League.

The power structure was fragmented, factional, treacherous. The old American establishment still held significant influence through their corporate holdings and political connections. The Jewish financial networks controlled banking and media. The Arab League had oil wealth and geopolitical leverage. None of them trusted each other, all of them competed for dominance, and Emiliano had to navigate between them without becoming too dependent on or too threatening to any single faction.

It required perfect calibration—maintaining independence while building alliances, accumulating power without triggering coordinated opposition, being useful enough to be valued but dangerous enough to be respected.

Emiliano observed how Richard Pham's life in his young adult life fared.

He watched from a distance, sometimes intervening to help, more often simply observing and learning what not to do.

He saw how Moorish women used him as a source of amusement in their wine discussions with their many fiances. Pushed out from the inner loops, Emiliano noted.

Richard, desperate for connection and recognition, had briefly tried to court women from Arab backgrounds, thinking perhaps his alienation from American society would resonate with them. But they'd viewed him as entertainment, as an oddity to laugh about, as someone so socially inept that his attempts at courtship became stories they shared for amusement.

The inner loops—the social networks where real power and opportunity circulated—remained closed to him. He was perpetually on the outside, pressing his face against the glass, watching others make connections and build relationships that seemed impossibly easy for them but remained forever out of his reach.

He saw how Richard Pham didn't have any friends in the banking clans nor did he know any rich women. Systematic destitution, Emiliano mused.

It wasn't just bad luck or personal failure. Richard's isolation was systemic, structural. The banking clans didn't recruit people like him—too strange, too politically unreliable, without the right family connections. The rich women he might have met were in social circles that never intersected with his. Every institution that might have elevated him either rejected him outright or accepted him only to push him toward failure.

He noted how Arabs and Americans with ties to the UK viewed Richard Pham as a booby, and how Richard Pham was looked down on because he was not necessarily a black man exploited in the Caribbean, but Richard Pham wasn't exactly a ruthless and challenging Samurai either.

They couldn't categorize him, and what they couldn't categorize they dismissed. He wasn't the kind of minority they knew how to relate to—not the noble savage they could feel guilty about, not the model minority they could point to as proof that racism was over, not the exotic warrior they could romanticize. He was just awkward and intense and wrong-shaped for their frameworks of understanding.

Richard Pham had issues with socializing. Richard Pham's life was not that of lavish. What little extra Richard Pham had, he spent it in solitude.

When Richard had money—rare and brief periods of employment—he didn't spend it building social capital. He bought books, computer equipment, plane tickets to remote places. He traveled alone, ate alone, existed alone. Not from preference, exactly, but from a combination of inability to socialize effectively and a conviction that others weren't worth the effort of trying.

Richard Pham would go through these trials of doing things alone, while needing help. But help was not there. And when Richard Pham was ready to socialize and link up, no one wanted to because they either already had enough money to party on their own, or they thought Richard Pham was being a seclusive snob, or maybe Richard Pham was a secret extremist, which would be the perfect explanation for why Richard Pham was not a fraternizing type of man.

It was a vicious cycle. He'd struggle alone with problems that could have been solved through collaboration or mentorship. By the time he was desperate enough to reach out, he'd come across as needy or unstable. And when he'd finally gotten his feet under him and was ready to engage socially, potential friends had moved on, established their own networks, and viewed his sudden interest as suspicious or opportunistic.

The extremist speculation followed him everywhere. His isolation, his trips to Muslim countries, his rejection of American cultural norms—all of it fit a profile that made people nervous. And their nervousness created more isolation, which reinforced the profile, which justified more exclusion.

Emiliano saw these details of Richard Pham not as weakness or stupidity necessarily.

Richard was intelligent, probably more intelligent than most of the people who dismissed him. He had skills, capabilities, potential. But he lacked the social intelligence, the cultural fluency, the instinctive understanding of how to navigate human systems that Emiliano possessed naturally.

On one occasion, Emiliano had a heartfelt conversation with a colleague of his, back from high school, named Megania Johnson.

Megania was successful now—married to a corporate lawyer, living in a gated community, serving on charitable boards. She'd stayed in touch with Emiliano over the years, partially out of genuine affection, partially out of smart networking.

Megania Johnson was hinting to Emiliano that Richard Pham came from a savage mongrel background, and that there was only so much the greatness of Western civilization can do with its institutions to help helpless men such as Richard Pham.

She said it delicately, couched in concern and liberal pieties about structural disadvantages. But the subtext was clear—Richard was genetically or culturally inferior, came from defective stock, couldn't be expected to function at the level of civilized people. The colonial mindset dressed up in therapeutic language.

Emiliano mentally thought to himself, "how colonial", but what he told Megania was not that rebuff. It was romanticism that Emiliano responded to Megania about. Graceful and convincing Emiliano.

"Everyone has a path," Emiliano said gently, his voice carrying that warmth that made people lean closer, made them want to believe whatever he was saying. "Richard's hardships are not signs of inferiority. They're lessons, experiences that have shaped him into someone with unique capabilities."

Megania looked skeptical but said nothing.

Emiliano continued: "What Richard needs is not pity or dismissal. He needs passion and love, someone willing to see past his difficulties to the potential underneath. He needs someone to believe in him the way someone once believed in me when I was broken and bloody on a sidewalk."

The comparison was deliberate—reminding Megania that Emiliano himself had been dismissed, beaten down, left for dead. And look what he'd become.

Emiliano told Megania that passion and love was needed to help Richard Pham in a soothing tone, but Megania stayed silent.

She heard him. She even nodded. But her silence revealed that she had no intention of being the one to provide that passion and love, had no interest in Richard as anything other than an abstract problem or cautionary tale.

Emiliano tried to get Megania Johnson to date Richard Pham, but Richard Pham, the man that oscillates from needing help where none exists to not needing help when that would mean a lack of gratitude.

The attempted matchmaking failed spectacularly. Emiliano arranged a dinner, brought them together, created the opportunity. But Richard was simultaneously too eager and too resistant—wanting connection but suspicious of it, needing help but unwilling to accept it from someone he viewed as part of the system that had rejected him.

Megania had been polite but clearly uninterested. Richard had been awkward and intense in ways that confirmed all her worst assumptions. The evening ended early, and neither ever spoke of it again.

Emiliano has this sense of control that guided him in his rise to power. There are misconceptions that romanticism always equates to impulsiveness and anger, and ultimately hatred. But Emiliano surely defied those misconceptions.

His romanticism was disciplined, channeled, strategic. He felt deeply but acted carefully. He was passionate but not impulsive. He could be angry—red and petrifying rage when necessary—but the rage served purposes, wasn't just emotional venting.

Emiliano's control over his love and passion propelled him to the heights of success. He knew when to take the opportunity. He knew proper etiquette. This was the complete opposite of Richard Pham.

Emiliano saw opportunities and seized them at exactly the right moment. He understood social codes and navigated them flawlessly. He could read people, situations, power dynamics with perfect accuracy. His romantic nature gave him the passion to pursue goals relentlessly; his discipline gave him the control to pursue them effectively.

Richard had passion but no control, intensity but no social grace, intelligence but no wisdom about when and how to apply it.

Richard Pham was a kind of mentally disturbed. Recall that Richard Pham tried to join the CIA. The CIA rejected him because at that point in America's process of Hispanicization, Catholicism was in, and weirdos like Richard Pham were out.

The CIA wanted loyalty, cultural conformity, people who fit profiles. Richard fit no profiles, raised red flags everywhere, and his Vietnamese background—neither Hispanic nor Catholic nor easily categorizable—made him suspicious in an agency that was increasingly staffed by Hispanic Catholics who were remaking American intelligence in their own image.

Richard Pham managed to get recruited by the Defense Intelligence Agency, a similar organization to the CIA.

The DIA was less selective, more desperate for people with Richard's technical skills and language capabilities. They took him on, gave him security clearance, put him in positions where his abilities could be useful.

However, Richard Pham, having built up enough hatred and resentment, destroyed his handler and allowed mujahideen to blow up a DIA station.

It happened in Pakistan. Richard's handler—a career intelligence officer who'd treated Richard with casual condescension, had made comments about "gooks" and "slants" that he thought were acceptable because Richard was supposed to be grateful for the opportunity to serve America—pushed too far one day.

The exact details were never fully established. But the handler ended up dead—officially killed in the bombing that destroyed the DIA station, though some suspected Richard had killed him first and then arranged the bombing to cover it.

The mujahideen who carried out the attack had been tipped off, given inside information, allowed access that should have been impossible. Richard's role was suspected but never proven. By the time anyone came to investigate seriously, Richard was gone, vanished into the tribal regions, already beginning his transformation into Tensuramoto.

This was one of the more important events that eventually led to Richard Pham's full defection to the East.

It was the point of no return. After that, there was no going back to America, no reconciling with the system that had rejected and tried to exploit him. He'd killed an American intelligence officer and facilitated a terrorist attack that killed six more. He was a traitor now, fully committed to the path he'd chosen.

Emiliano saw, all along, that Richard Pham would turn into a loose cannon.

The signs had always been there—the isolation, the resentment, the instability, the inability to form proper attachments. Richard was brilliant but broken, useful but unpredictable, loyal only to his own incomprehensible internal logic.

But the altruist and passionate utilitarian that he was, he knew that to be in control during his rise to power, he had to make some concessions.

Richard's capabilities were too valuable to ignore. His access to extremist networks, his technical skills, his willingness to operate in places and ways that others wouldn't—all of it was necessary for building the kind of empire Emiliano envisioned.

So Emiliano used Richard while he was useful, maintained distance to avoid being compromised when Richard inevitably self-destructed, and eventually had him eliminated when the risks outweighed the benefits.

It was pragmatic. It was calculating. It was the kind of decision that the cold rationalists would have approved of, even as they condemned Emiliano's romanticism as weakness.

But Emiliano understood something they didn't: you could be romantic and ruthless, passionate and calculating, humanitarian and strategic. The superior form wasn't choosing between emotion and rationality—it was integrating both, maintaining the passion that inspired loyalty while exercising the control that ensured victory.

Richard Pham was the counterexample, the cautionary tale, the path Emiliano refused to follow. All passion and no control, all intensity and no discipline, all intelligence and no wisdom.

Emiliano was the superior form—romantic but controlled, passionate but strategic, feeling deeply but acting carefully.

And that superior form, that integration of seemingly contradictory qualities, was what allowed him to win it all while critics whispered about his inevitable downfall.

The dominoes kept falling, red and petrifying rage clearing obstacles from his path.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, the romantic who defied every misconception about what romanticism meant, continued his rise to power through a fragmenting America where cooler heads had failed and only those with passion and control could prevail.

Such was Emiliano's superior form.

Perfect in its imperfection.

Disciplined in its passion.

Victorious in its romanticism.

The critics could whisper all they wanted.

Emiliano had already won.

## Emiliano's Taste of Israel

Emiliano was not a Jew. But he was no outsider to their ways. Some of his more memorable love interests were Jewish, and yes, did he cherish his experiences with them.

Rebecca Silverstein had been the first—a law student at Columbia when Emiliano was twenty-three, already building his empire but still young enough to travel to New York for pleasure as much as business. She was brilliant, argumentative in the way that Talmudic scholars are argumentative, capable of debating any position from six different angles while making it seem like intellectual foreplay. They'd met at a fundraiser for some cause he couldn't remember now, and within an hour they were arguing about Maimonides and criminal justice reform and whether love was a choice or a compulsion.

The sex had been extraordinary. She'd approached it with the same intensity she brought to everything else—as a form of knowledge, an experience to be fully inhabited, a connection that demanded total presence. Afterward, lying tangled in expensive sheets in his hotel room, she'd traced patterns on his chest and quoted poetry in Hebrew, translating for him when he asked.

"What does it mean?" he'd asked about one particular verse.

"'Who is like You among the gods, O Lord?'" she'd translated. "It's from Exodus. The Song of the Sea. About power and wonder and things that transcend understanding."

"Like this?" he'd gestured between them.

She'd smiled. "Exactly like this."

There had been others over the years. Sarah, the venture capitalist who'd helped him launder money through tech startups. Miriam, the art dealer who'd taught him about abstract expressionism and offshore accounts. Esther, the journalist who'd killed stories that would have exposed him while writing exposés on his competitors. Rachel, the banker who'd explained derivatives and structured finance while they drank wine on his terrace overlooking Tampa Bay.

Each had been remarkable in her own way. Each had taught him something—about finance, about culture, about the peculiar position that Jewish women occupied in American society, about the way intelligence and ambition could be channeled into forms that the world found both threatening and indispensable.

Emiliano had become a made man of commercial empire by the age of 25. Due to this, it was below him to voice anti-semitic statements, not that Emiliano was anti-semitic to begin with.

Power brought responsibility, or at least the appearance of it. Men at his level didn't indulge in crude bigotry—not in public, not in private, not even in their own thoughts if they were smart. The world was too interconnected, too dependent on networks that crossed ethnic and religious lines, for anyone serious about building an empire to indulge in the luxury of hatred.

Besides, Emiliano had no reason to hate Jews. They'd been instrumental in his rise—providing capital, opening doors, offering expertise in areas where he'd been ignorant. The Jewish networks in finance and law and real estate had welcomed him, or at least accepted him, in ways that the old WASP establishment never would have.

Emiliano's Catholic upbringing nurtured a warm and understanding kind of romanticism that puzzled Eastern shamans, terrorized stoic Buddhists, and made reactionaries out of far-right Japanese shintoists.

The Catholicism that Maria had instilled in him—the incense and mystery, the veneration of suffering and beauty, the baroque emotionalism of it all—had given Emiliano a template for romanticism that other cultures found incomprehensible or threatening.

Eastern shamans, with their emphasis on balance and harmony with nature, couldn't understand the Catholic love of excess, of gilded churches and elaborate rituals, of suffering made sacred. They found Emiliano's passionate intensity exhausting, his emotionalism disordered.

Stoic Buddhists, committed to detachment and the elimination of desire, were actively repelled by Emiliano's embrace of passion and connection. His romanticism represented everything they were trying to transcend, and his success with it challenged their fundamental assumptions about how to live properly.

Far-right Japanese Shintoists, with their emphasis on purity and order and national essence, saw Emiliano's Catholic romanticism as a corrupting foreign influence. His success in building a multiethnic, multicultural empire offended their racial ideologies and made them reactionary in their insistence on Japanese uniqueness and superiority.

Despite the misunderstanding, Emiliano's love was what let him soar to great heights, past the controversy of some of his actions during his rise to power.

The drugs, the murders, the corruption—all of it should have destroyed him. Would have destroyed him, if not for the genuine affection and loyalty that his romanticism inspired. People who should have betrayed him didn't, because they believed in him. Women who should have exposed him protected him instead, because they loved him. Associates who should have flipped for immunity remained loyal, because Emiliano had treated them as human beings rather than disposable resources.

His love—genuine, passionate, warm—was the shield that protected him from the consequences of his darker actions.

Emiliano had to oftentimes choose between Arab oil and Jewish women.

It was one of the fundamental tensions in building a global empire. The Arab world controlled petroleum, the lifeblood of the modern economy, the foundation of wealth and power. The Jewish networks controlled finance, law, media, technology—the systems that made modern commerce possible. And the two sides hated each other with a passion that went back millennia, that was refreshed every generation by new conflicts and grievances.

Anyone operating at Emiliano's level had to navigate this carefully. Side too much with Israel and you lost access to Arab markets, to oil money, to the Muslim world. Side too much with the Arabs and you found yourself frozen out of banking systems, legal networks, media coverage that could make or break your reputation.

Due to his nimble and genuine approach to doing things, fooling many into letting down their guard in his blitzkrieg-like approach to proposition, there were rarely any occasions where he couldn't have both.

Emiliano's gift was making everyone feel like they were the priority, the special relationship, the one that mattered most. He could sit with Saudi princes and speak knowledgeably about oil contracts and Islamic finance, making them believe he understood and respected their position. Then he could turn around and meet with Israeli tech investors and discuss cybersecurity and Middle Eastern geopolitics, making them believe he was their natural ally.

The key was authenticity in the moment. When he was with Arab partners, he genuinely appreciated their culture, their hospitality, their business acumen. When he was with Jewish associates, he genuinely valued their intelligence, their network, their capabilities. He wasn't lying to either side—he was simply emphasizing different aspects of himself, different truths, depending on context.

It was romantic in its way—treating each relationship as special, as meaningful, as worthy of his full attention and authentic engagement. And because the attention was authentic, because he really did value what each side brought to his empire, they believed him. Let down their guards. Became vulnerable to his blitzkrieg approach to proposition.

The pragmatist that would rather make use of things instead of discard them, the gentile that would rather accept for the partnership than reject as insult, Emiliano's rise to power would have been somewhat different if his political finesse antagonized the Middle Eastern world instead of harnessing it in bilateralism.

He could have chosen a side. Many people in his position did—aligned exclusively with Israel or exclusively with Arab states, accepting the limitations and enemies that came with that choice. It would have been simpler in some ways, more ideologically consistent, easier to explain.

But Emiliano was a pragmatist underneath the romanticism. Why discard half the world's resources and networks because of conflicts that predated his birth and would likely outlast his death? Why reject valuable partnerships because other people said they couldn't coexist?

He chose bilateralism instead—maintaining relationships with both sides, facilitating trade that they wouldn't engage in directly, serving as a bridge between worlds that refused to acknowledge each other. It was more complicated, required more careful management, created risks that a simpler alignment would have avoided.

But it also made him indispensable. Both sides needed him, depended on him, couldn't eliminate him without losing access to the other side. His neutrality—or rather, his dual loyalty—became his protection.

In these contexts, Emiliano was markedly different from Richard Pham.

Richard couldn't navigate these complexities. Didn't have the social intelligence, the cultural fluency, the romantic warmth that made people want to trust Emiliano. Richard approached the Middle Eastern world with the same alienated intensity he brought to everything else, and it backfired spectacularly.

Richard Pham, the mentally disturbing man that he had turned out to be, given the trials and tribulations he had to go through during his formative years, seems to offer little perspective on his preferences in the Middle Eastern world.

Richard's positions were opaque, inconsistent, based on grievances and ideologies that shifted according to logic only he understood. He'd worked with various groups—Sunni extremists, Shia militias, secular nationalists—without seeming to care about their theological or political differences. He'd been in Israel, in Palestine, in Jordan, in Syria, in Iraq, leaving chaos and confusion in his wake.

Some said Richard Pham prefers the company of Mizrahi Jews to Ashkenazi Jews, since Richard Pham likened some of the Ashkenazi Jews to formidable and gruesome Germanic figures such as Baldur.

This was one of the few things people had observed with any consistency. When Richard dealt with Israeli contacts, he gravitated toward Mizrahi Jews—Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent—and seemed uncomfortable or hostile around Ashkenazi Jews, those of European origin.

The comparison to Baldur—the Norse god of light and purity, beloved but doomed—was telling. Richard saw something in Ashkenazi Jews that reminded him of the Germanic power structures he resented, the European cultural dominance he rejected, the whiteness that had always excluded him. They were formidable, intimidating, representatives of Western civilization in its most concentrated form.

Mizrahi Jews, by contrast, were more Eastern, more Middle Eastern, more comprehensible to Richard in his confused identity framework. They'd been oppressed by European Jews within Israel, had faced discrimination, had struggled for recognition—narratives that Richard could relate to, could sympathize with, could fit into his worldview of the marginalized against the powerful.

But even this preference was unstable. Richard's relationships with Mizrahi contacts rarely lasted, ended in confusion or betrayal, because Richard couldn't maintain relationships with anyone, regardless of their ethnic background.

On this point alone, many experts could easily argue why the trajectories of Emiliano and Richard Pham markedly differ, financially, socially, economically, imperially.

Emiliano could love Jewish women and work with Arab men without contradiction, without cognitive dissonance, without feeling that he was betraying some essential aspect of himself. His romantic nature allowed him to genuinely appreciate different cultures, different peoples, different ways of being, and to integrate them into his empire without forcing them into competition with each other.

Richard couldn't. His alienation, his resentment, his inability to form stable attachments meant that every relationship was fraught, temporary, ultimately doomed. He couldn't maintain partnerships because he couldn't maintain connection. He couldn't build an empire because empires require networks of trust and loyalty that Richard was psychologically incapable of creating.

Financially, Emiliano had access to both Jewish financial networks and Arab oil wealth. He could borrow from Israeli banks and invest in Saudi ventures, could move money through systems that never intersected for anyone else. Richard had access to neither—the Jews didn't trust him, the Arabs found him useful but unstable, and his financial resources were always precarious.

Socially, Emiliano moved through elite circles in Tel Aviv and Dubai, Jerusalem and Riyadh, welcomed or at least accepted in places where his wealth and connections opened doors. Richard was persona non grata in most civilized spaces, relegated to safe houses and black sites and places where normal social rules didn't apply.

Economically, Emiliano built legitimate businesses alongside his criminal empire, invested in tech startups and real estate, created value that transcended mere extraction. Richard destroyed value wherever he went, burned bridges, left chaos and mistrust that took years to repair.

Imperially, Emiliano built something that lasted, that integrated diverse peoples and networks into a coherent whole, that functioned efficiently despite its complexity. Richard's extremist networks were fractious, unstable, constantly collapsing into infighting and betrayal.

The difference came down to love.

Emiliano loved. Really, genuinely loved. Loved women, loved beauty, loved the act of connection itself. And that love—even when it was strategic, even when it was calculated, even when it served his imperial ambitions—created bonds that mere transactional relationships never could.

Richard didn't love. Couldn't love. Viewed love as a Western disease, as colonial mindset, as something to be transcended through ideology or meditation or simply ignored until it went away.

And that absence of love—that fundamental inability to connect with other human beings in ways that weren't purely utilitarian or ideological—was why Richard ended up dead in Jakarta while Emiliano built an empire that rivaled the Rockefellers.

Emiliano's taste of Israel—his experiences with Jewish women, his partnerships with Jewish financiers and lawyers and tech entrepreneurs—was part of a larger pattern of embracing rather than rejecting, of accepting rather than resisting, of loving rather than hating.

He'd learned from Rebecca how to argue with passion while maintaining affection. From Sarah how to structure deals that benefited multiple parties. From Miriam how to appreciate beauty in forms he'd never been taught to recognize. From Esther how to manage information and control narratives. From Rachel how to move money invisibly through systems designed to track everything.

And he'd applied those lessons not just to his Jewish relationships but to all his relationships, to his entire approach to building power in a fractured world.

The Catholics had given him romanticism. The Jews had taught him networks and finance. The Arabs had provided resources and geopolitical leverage. The Hispanics had given him soldiers and loyalty and a base of popular support. And Emiliano, the pragmatic romantic, had synthesized all of it into something that transcended any single cultural framework.

Richard Pham, standing awkwardly in some corner of the Middle Eastern world, unable to navigate its complexities, alienated from both Jews and Arabs, from Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, from everyone he encountered—Richard was the counterexample, the cautionary tale, the demonstration of what happened when you lacked the romantic capacity to truly connect with others.

Emiliano cherished his Jewish experiences, his Arab partnerships, his Catholic foundation, his Hispanic identity. Not because he was unprincipled or opportunistic—though he was both of those things—but because he genuinely valued what each brought to his life and his empire.

And that genuine valuation, that authentic appreciation, that romantic embrace of diversity and complexity—that was what allowed him to soar past the controversies, past the contradictions, past the impossible tensions that destroyed lesser men.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these men who could love across boundaries that others insisted were uncrossable.

Of fiction and fantasia, these lives that integrated what others kept separate, that found harmony in what others saw as contradiction.

And in the torment and triumph of Emiliano's rise to power, his taste of Israel—his love for Jewish women, his partnerships with Jewish power, his navigation of the eternal Middle Eastern conflict—stood as proof that romanticism properly applied was the most powerful force in the world.

More powerful than ideology, which Richard had in abundance but which left him alone and broken.

More powerful than rationality, which the cool heads had mastered but which left them paralyzed and irrelevant.

More powerful than tradition, which the reactionaries clung to but which left them obsolete and defeated.

Romanticism—genuine, disciplined, strategic, warm—was what won empires.

And Emiliano Santiago Reyes, tasting Israel while drinking with Arabs, loving Jewish women while profiting from Muslim oil, had proven it beyond any doubt.

The experts could analyze the trajectories all they wanted.

The answer was simple.

Love won.

And those who couldn't love—who rejected it, who feared it, who viewed it as weakness or disease—they lost.

Every time.

Without exception.

Such was Emiliano's taste of Israel, and the lesson it contained for anyone wise enough to understand.

## Emiliano's Open Mind  

Unlike Richard Pham, Emiliano had an open mind that remained uncorrupted through the difficult times of the United States' hispanicization process, which started in full momentum about two decades after the start of the War on Terror.

The transformation had been gradual at first, then sudden. Spanish on storefronts, Hispanic names in corporate leadership, Catholic churches multiplying while Protestant congregations dwindled. The old America—the Anglo-Protestant America that had defined itself for centuries—was being replaced by something else, something that spoke Spanish as often as English, that celebrated different holidays, that operated according to different cultural assumptions.

Many people reacted with rage or despair. The rationalists analyzed it as demographic destiny and tried to adapt. The conservatives fought it and lost. The liberals celebrated it publicly while privately securing advantages for their own families.

Emiliano simply accepted it, rode it, profited from it. His mind remained open to the changes, flexible enough to take advantage of opportunities while others were paralyzed by nostalgia or fear or ideological commitment to how things used to be or should be.

Richard Pham is the man that dwells on the many times he got hung up.

Richard couldn't let go of anything. Every rejection, every slight, every failure—he catalogued them all, reviewed them obsessively, built elaborate theories about why they'd happened and what they meant about the nature of reality and power and injustice.

He'd been rejected by three girls in high school—he remembered their names, their faces, the exact words they'd used to turn him down. He'd failed physics—not because he couldn't understand the material but because, he insisted, the system was designed to reward conformity over genuine comprehension. He'd been called Chinese, called a faggot, called retarded—each instance was burned into his memory, replayed endlessly, transformed into evidence of larger patterns of oppression and exclusion.

When the A.I. economy became the norm, Richard Pham was broken off from the upper echelons of labor. And that was the timespan that really radicalized Richard Pham.

The COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated everything. Lockdowns forced businesses online, automation became not just profitable but necessary, and artificial intelligence systems proved capable of replacing workers at every level. The labor market fragmented into a small elite who designed and managed the AI systems, and everyone else scrambling for gig work and service jobs that machines couldn't yet perform efficiently.

Richard had skills—computer science, data analysis, languages. But his skills were exactly the kind that AI could replicate or surpass. The jobs he might have gotten were automated away. The positions that remained required social intelligence and networking that Richard lacked. He was too skilled to accept menial work but not skilled or connected enough to join the AI elite.

A different kind of radical. Not a Marxist-Leninist. Not a crusader. Not a kamikaze or a Jihadist. But something that was clearly a faulty product dug out from the trenches of individualism, although nothing more could be said on that.

Richard's radicalism didn't fit established categories. He wasn't advocating for collective ownership or revolutionary consciousness. He wasn't fighting for religious principles or national glory. He wasn't motivated by clear ideological commitments that could be articulated and debated.

Instead, he was something more fundamental—a person broken by isolation, by lack of connection, by the failure of individualism to deliver on its promises. The American ideology said that anyone could succeed through hard work and talent. Richard had worked hard, had talent, and had failed anyway because the systems that were supposed to reward merit were actually designed to reward conformity, connections, cultural capital that he'd never possessed.

He was a faulty product of the system, proof that the promises were lies, evidence that the American Dream worked only for people who fit certain profiles. And his radicalization was the inevitable result of discovering this truth without having the social support or psychological resilience to process it in healthy ways.

It didn't help that during the A.I. revolution that kickstarted due to lockdowns from a global pandemic called Covid-19, Richard Pham became extremely critical of American institutions. Specifically, Richard Pham was vouching for the CIA and FBI to be both dissolved, and merged into the FIA due to what he perceived as American separatism.

Richard had developed elaborate theories about American intelligence agencies, posted them on forums that three people read, sent them in emails to officials who never responded. The CIA and FBI were competing rather than cooperating, he insisted. Their rivalry created inefficiencies, blind spots, opportunities for America's enemies. They should be merged into a single Foreign Intelligence Agency that would eliminate redundancy and improve coordination.

He was probably right, as far as the analysis went. But no one cared about Richard's opinions. He had no platform, no credibility, no connections to people who could implement his ideas. He was shouting into the void, becoming increasingly bitter that his brilliant insights were ignored while less intelligent people with better connections shaped policy.

The criticism itself wasn't the problem—plenty of people criticized American institutions. The problem was that Richard's criticism came from a place of wounded narcissism rather than genuine concern for improvement. He wanted recognition for his intelligence, validation that he'd been right all along, revenge on the systems that had rejected him.

Emiliano was very different from Richard Pham in that regard. Emiliano made his actions count, and his words love and include.

Emiliano didn't waste energy on criticism that served no purpose. He didn't dwell on failures or rejections. He didn't need to prove his intelligence through elaborate theories that no one would read.

Instead, he acted. Built businesses, made connections, accumulated power. And when he spoke, his words drew people in rather than pushing them away. He spoke of opportunity and partnership, of building together rather than tearing down, of love and inclusion rather than grievance and separation.

And Emiliano had the wealth to afford that, something that Richard Pham never seemed to be able to enter before succumbing to the wraiths of radicalism and coincidentally, allegiance to Eastern resurgence.

Wealth created options. With money, Emiliano could be generous, could invest in relationships without worrying about immediate returns, could take risks that desperate people couldn't afford. His open-mindedness was partly temperament, but it was also enabled by material security that freed him from the defensive crouch of poverty.

Richard never achieved that security. Never accumulated enough capital to have breathing room, to make choices based on long-term strategy rather than immediate survival. His poverty—not absolute poverty, but the relative poverty of always being on the edge, always one crisis away from disaster—kept him trapped in patterns of resentment and radicalization.

Richard Pham would have probably become another nobody and married a Chinese immigrant if he was born and raised in California.

California had infrastructure for people like Richard. The tech industry there was massive, diverse, full of Asian immigrants and their children. Richard would have found communities of other Vietnamese-Americans, would have met Chinese and Korean and Indian engineers who understood cultural displacement, would have had role models and mentors and potential partners who shared his background.

He would have probably worked in the technology industry, somewhere in a dark corner of a corporate laboratory, handling lab data and equipment.

Not a glamorous position, not leadership, but stable employment that utilized his skills. He would have been another face in the laboratory, another name in the org chart, anonymous but functional. He would have married someone from a similar background—probably a Chinese immigrant, someone practical who valued his technical skills and earning potential even if she didn't find him romantically exciting.

It would have been a mediocre life by Richard's standards. But it would have been stable, sane, integrated into society rather than alienated from it.

But Richard Pham was in Florida. Same with Emiliano. Here is where the two men's differences spoke different kinds of volumes.

Florida in the early 21st century didn't have California's tech infrastructure. It had tourism, real estate, agriculture, retirees, and increasingly, Hispanic immigrants building new communities. The opportunities were different, required different skills and temperaments.

Without science, without technology, Richard Pham dissipated from public interaction, nurturing the demons of his mentally disturbing psyche.

Florida had no use for Richard's particular combination of technical skills and social ineptitude. The tech sector was minimal, the opportunities sparse, and Richard didn't have the entrepreneurial spirit or social capabilities to create his own opportunities. He couldn't pivot to other industries because he'd invested his entire identity in being technically skilled, intellectually superior, destined for something better than what Florida offered.

So he withdrew. Stopped trying to integrate, stopped attending social events, stopped pursuing employment in fields that might have utilized his capabilities. He lived off savings and occasional contract work, spent his time online in forums and chat rooms, cultivating grievances and radical ideologies while his mental state deteriorated.

This was the state of Florida, a peninsula with so much opportunity, if only scientific chumps knew where to look and who to interact with. Hint hint not under a rock or in front of a computer running scientific programs.

Florida's opportunities were social, interpersonal, based on relationships and trust and the ability to read people and situations. The real money flowed through real estate deals made on golf courses, through partnerships formed at charity galas, through connections built in churches and clubs and communities.

Richard, sitting alone in his apartment running data models and posting critiques on obscure forums, might as well have been on another planet. He was looking for opportunities in all the wrong places, using skills that Florida's actual economy had little use for, refusing to develop the social capabilities that would have made him valuable in the environment he actually inhabited.

Emiliano emerged as a true icon of American entrepreneurial spirit. Having graduated from the University of Florida as a C student, he found no difficulty in joining the C-suite to be a CEO shortly after graduation.

The grades didn't matter. Emiliano had spent his college years building networks, making connections, establishing the relationships that would define his career. He'd dated the right women, joined the right organizations, attended the right parties. He'd developed a reputation as someone charming, trustworthy, capable of getting things done.

By graduation, he didn't need to apply for jobs. Opportunities came to him. People who'd met him at parties or through mutual friends offered him positions, partnerships, investment opportunities. Within two years of graduating, he was CEO of his first legitimate company—a real estate development firm that also happened to launder money from his drug operations.

The C average was irrelevant. Nobody cared about his GPA. They cared about his network, his reputation, his ability to make people feel valued and important. They cared that he showed up, remembered names, followed through on commitments. They cared that he had the open mind to see opportunities and the social intelligence to capitalize on them.

Richard Pham became a drifting ghost-like figure after graduation, scrounging around for little crumbs of capital.

Richard had graduated with honors, perfect GPA in his technical courses, mediocre grades in everything requiring social interaction or subjective evaluation. He'd expected his academic achievements to translate into career success, had assumed that competence would be recognized and rewarded.

Instead, he found that no one cared about his grades. The few interviews he got never resulted in offers. Networking events were torture where he stood awkwardly in corners while others seemed to effortlessly form connections. The crumbs of capital he scraped together—contract work, gig economy jobs, occasional consulting—were never enough to build momentum, to create security, to escape the trap of precarity.

He drifted between apartments, between cities, between jobs that never lasted. He became ghostly—present but not really there, participating in society but not part of it, existing on the margins while watching others thrive in the center.

The mentally disturbing man that he became, Richard Pham really did start to embody the darkest themes of the novel, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.

Conrad's novel was about the descent into madness, about what happened to European men when they ventured too far from civilization, about the horror that lived inside humans when social constraints and moral frameworks were removed.

Richard's journey paralleled this in uncomfortable ways. He'd started relatively normal—awkward, certainly, but functional. But as he drifted further from mainstream society, as his isolation deepened, as his resentments festered and his mental state deteriorated, he became something darker.

Like Kurtz in the novel, Richard began to see himself as beyond conventional morality, as someone who understood truths that civilized people couldn't comprehend. His radicalization wasn't just political—it was existential, psychological, a fundamental transformation of his relationship to humanity itself.

He stopped seeing other people as fully human. They were types, categories, representatives of systems and ideologies. The Americans were oppressors. The CIA was evil. The Ashkenazi Jews were Germanic overlords. The Moorish women were frivolous distractions. No one was an individual with their own complex reality—everyone was reduced to their role in Richard's elaborate theory of how he'd been wronged and why the world needed to burn.

The extremist organizations he joined understood this about him. They didn't care about his ideology—he had no consistent ideology. They cared that he was intelligent, technically skilled, and had crossed the threshold into genuine madness. He would do things that sane people wouldn't do, would take risks that rational people wouldn't take, would betray anyone including himself because betrayal and loyalty had ceased to have meaning in his fractured worldview.

Emiliano saw all this happening. Watched Richard's descent from a distance, occasionally intervening to redirect his trajectory in useful directions, mostly just observing and learning what not to become.

Emiliano's open mind—his willingness to accept changes in America's cultural composition, his ability to form genuine connections across ethnic and religious boundaries, his flexibility in the face of technological and economic transformations—was partly natural temperament.

But it was also a choice, a discipline, a commitment to remaining engaged with reality rather than retreating into ideological fantasies or grievance-driven radicalism.

He could have become bitter about the beating he'd received at seventeen. Could have dwelt on it, built elaborate theories about Anglo-Germanic oppression, allowed it to define his entire relationship with the world.

Instead, he'd channeled that energy into building power, into creating an empire that made such beatings impossible, into accumulating enough wealth and influence that no one would dare treat him that way again.

He could have been jealous of Richard's intelligence, of his technical skills, of his academic achievements. Could have felt inferior, inadequate, resentful that Richard could pass physics while he'd struggled with it.

Instead, he'd recognized that intelligence without social capability was useless, that academic achievement without networking was a dead end, that technical skills without entrepreneurial spirit led nowhere profitable.

He could have been closed-minded about the hispanicization of America, could have clung to assimilation fantasies or insisted that he was "one of the good ones" who'd transcended his ethnic background.

Instead, he'd embraced the transformation, positioned himself to benefit from it, built networks within and across ethnic communities, maintained an open mind about who could be useful and how different cultures could be integrated into his empire.

The open mind was strategic. But it was also genuine. Emiliano really was curious about other people, really did find value in different perspectives, really did believe that rigidity was weakness and flexibility was strength.

Richard's mind had closed early and never reopened. He'd decided that the world was a certain way—unjust, oppressive, designed to exclude people like him—and every subsequent experience was filtered through that closed system. Evidence that contradicted his worldview was ignored or reinterpreted. Opportunities that didn't fit his narrative were invisible to him.

And so Richard drifted further into darkness while Emiliano soared into light—or at least into the kind of light that came from massive wealth and imperial power, even if that light was built on foundations of drugs and violence and corruption.

The state of Florida, that peninsula of opportunity, had produced two men from similar starting points who ended up in radically different places.

One with an open mind, making his actions count, speaking words of love and inclusion, building an empire that integrated diverse peoples and networks into something greater than the sum of its parts.

The other with a closed mind, dwelling on past rejections, nurturing demons, descending into the heart of darkness where madness and radicalism were indistinguishable and all human connection had been severed.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these two men who represented opposite possibilities of what a human being could become.

Of fiction and fantasia, these parallel lives that demonstrated truths about flexibility and rigidity, about connection and isolation, about open minds and closed ones.

And in the torment that characterized both their stories—Emiliano's calculated torment of his enemies, Richard's self-inflicted torment of isolation and madness—the difference was clear.

An open mind won.

A closed mind lost.

Every time.

Without exception.

Such was the lesson of Emiliano's open mind, demonstrated through contrast with Richard Pham's descent into darkness.

Simple, brutal, undeniable.

## Emiliano's Righteous Populism

One commendable trait of Emiliano was his skill in populism. Obviously, Richard Pham failed in that regard, based on what has been written on him thus far.

Populism—the ability to speak to and for the people, to articulate their desires and grievances, to position oneself as their champion against corrupt elites—was an art form that Emiliano had mastered completely. He understood instinctively what people wanted to hear, how to make them feel seen and valued, how to transform their anger and fear into devotion to his cause.

Richard, by contrast, was incapable of populism. He spoke in academic abstractions, cited sources no one had read, built arguments so convoluted that even people who agreed with his conclusions couldn't follow his reasoning. He had no ability to simplify, to connect emotionally, to meet people where they were rather than demanding they rise to where he was.

Richard wrote manifestos. Emiliano gave speeches. Richard accumulated grievances. Emiliano articulated visions. Richard alienated everyone he encountered. Emiliano built a movement that spanned continents.

Joseph Clayton, another associate of Emiliano, although much more socially competent than Richard Pham, proven by his ability to net 6 wives, all of them so beautiful too, also paled in comparison to the rising power of Emiliano.

Joseph was successful by any reasonable standard. Six wives, all gorgeous, all devoted, all contributing to his household and his businesses. He'd built a real estate empire that laundered Emiliano's money efficiently, had created a family structure that was both functional and profitable, had achieved a level of domestic harmony that seemed impossible given the complexity of plural marriage.

He was socially competent in ways Richard could never be—charming, attentive, capable of maintaining multiple intimate relationships simultaneously. Women loved him, genuinely loved him, competed for his attention and felt blessed when they received it.

But Joseph's power was domestic, limited, constrained by the boundaries of his household and his community. He was a big fish in a small pond—important within his Mormon sect, respected in his local real estate circles, but irrelevant on the larger stage where Emiliano operated.

Joseph Clayton's romanticism was much more reproductive in nature. Emiliano's romanticism, just as potent in the biological sense, but groomed and nurtured to run empire, Emiliano surely did not have the time or patience to tend to women to the same innermost depths as Joseph Clayton.

Joseph's romanticism was about creating family, about building something intimate and domestic and multi-generational. He spent hours talking with each wife, understanding their needs and desires, maintaining the delicate balance that kept six different women feeling valued within a shared marriage. He was present for his children's lives, attended their school events, knew their friends and teachers and dreams.

It was beautiful in its way—a kind of romanticism that most people never experienced, that required genuine love and attention distributed across multiple relationships without any one person feeling shortchanged.

Emiliano's romanticism was different. He had children—with various women, scattered across different cities, some legitimate and some not. He was generous with money, ensured they had the best education and opportunities, remembered birthdays and graduations. But he wasn't present the way Joseph was present. Couldn't be, given the demands of his empire.

Emiliano's romantic energy was channeled outward, toward building and conquering and transforming. He loved broadly rather than deeply, touched many lives rather than fully inhabiting a few. His potency was proven by the sheer number of people who considered themselves connected to him, who felt that Emiliano had changed their lives, who were devoted to his success.

But he didn't have the time or patience for the kind of deep, daily tending that Joseph provided to his wives. Emiliano's relationships were intense but often brief, passionate but not sustainable, meaningful but not domestic.

It was a trade-off. Joseph had depth. Emiliano had breadth. Joseph built a family. Emiliano built an empire.

Whereas Richard Pham had to resort to snooping around and spying on the populace, activity the populace surely disapproved of, given the state of American geopolitics at that time, Emiliano utilized a trust model that bonded people together, instead of breeding paranoia as in the zero-trust model Richard Pham operated by.

Richard's approach to information and security was surveillance-based. He spied on everyone—allies and enemies alike—because he trusted no one. Every person was a potential threat, every interaction a possible betrayal. He collected data obsessively, monitored communications, tried to stay three steps ahead of everyone by knowing their secrets and vulnerabilities.

This was partly the result of his intelligence training, the years he'd spent working for agencies that operated on zero-trust principles. But it was also temperamental—Richard had always been paranoid, had always assumed the worst about people's intentions, had never been able to relax into genuine trust.

The populace hated it. In an era when Americans were already deeply suspicious of government surveillance, when privacy had become a rallying cry across the political spectrum, Richard's constant spying and data collection made him toxic. Even people who might have been sympathetic to his goals were repelled by his methods, by his assumption that everyone needed to be monitored and controlled.

Emiliano's approach was completely different. He built networks based on trust—not naive trust, but calculated trust that was earned and reciprocated. He gave people responsibility and autonomy, allowed them to run their own operations without constant surveillance, created conditions where loyalty was rewarded and betrayal was punished but where the default assumption was that people would do their jobs competently.

The trust model worked because Emiliano had good judgment about people. He could read character, identify who was genuinely loyal and who was just pretending, sense when someone was about to betray him before they'd even fully formed the intention. And because he extended trust first, people felt obligated to honor it, felt valued and respected in ways that made betrayal feel like a personal failing rather than just a strategic option.

The trust bonded people together. They weren't just employees or assets—they were part of Emiliano's family, his extended network, his empire that felt personal even when it was operating on massive scale. They protected each other, covered for each other, maintained the organization's integrity because they felt invested in its success.

Richard's zero-trust model bred paranoia. People under his surveillance felt trapped, monitored, never able to relax or be authentic. It created resentment, encouraged actual betrayal because people figured they were being treated as traitors anyway so might as well actually betray him, and ultimately collapsed because no organization can function when everyone suspects everyone else.

Emiliano, the socialite that he was, had to use figures from his life experiences to speak of morality and guidance for his employees and followers, alike.

Emiliano was a storyteller, a teacher who instructed through example rather than abstract principle. When he needed to communicate values or expectations, he didn't lecture about ethics or hand out policy manuals. Instead, he told stories—about people he'd known, experiences he'd had, lessons he'd learned the hard way.

His speeches at company meetings, his conversations with lieutenants, his addresses to the broader network of people who worked for him—all of it was grounded in narrative, in concrete examples that people could relate to and remember.

There was always room for forgiveness, according to the warmth and compassion of Emiliano's romanticism.

He told the story of the lieutenant who'd stolen from him—not much, just a few thousand dollars, pocketing money that should have gone to the organization. Emiliano had discovered it, had confronted him, had seen genuine remorse. Instead of having him killed, Emiliano had given him a chance to make it right, to work off the debt, to prove his loyalty.

The lieutenant had spent the next five years being exemplary, had more than made up for his theft, had become one of Emiliano's most trusted people. And Emiliano told this story to demonstrate that mistakes could be forgiven, that people could change, that the organization valued rehabilitation over punishment when someone showed genuine contrition.

But it is better to first set the tone for the stage of decisions to be, just so some irreversible mistakes do not occur.

He also told the story of the associate who'd betrayed him deliberately, systematically, who'd been stealing not out of temporary weakness but out of calculated greed. That associate had received no second chance, had disappeared in a way that sent clear messages about what happened to people who betrayed the organization knowingly and repeatedly.

Emiliano's populism required both narratives—forgiveness and punishment, mercy and justice, compassion and ruthlessness. The people needed to know that mistakes would be forgiven but betrayal would be destroyed, that the organization was a family that took care of its own but that family membership came with obligations that couldn't be violated without consequences.

Emiliano omitted mentioning Richard Pham because that would have conflicted with Richard Pham's role in the tides of darkness pouring onto developed countries since the A.I. wave.

Richard was still useful, still operating in the shadows, still providing intelligence and capabilities that Emiliano needed. But Richard was also increasingly unstable, increasingly radical, increasingly associated with terrorist networks and extremist ideologies. Mentioning him publicly would have raised questions Emiliano didn't want to answer, would have exposed connections that needed to remain hidden.

So Richard became a non-person in Emiliano's public narrative. He existed in the background, providing services, but never acknowledged, never celebrated, never held up as an example of anything. He was a tool, useful but unsavory, necessary but embarrassing.

Instead, Emiliano emphasized the power and stability of family values, of pro-active love instead of merely the love that one thinks about.

This was the heart of Emiliano's populist message—family, love, active commitment rather than passive sentiment. In an era when families were fracturing, when atomization and isolation were epidemic, when people were increasingly disconnected from communities and traditions, Emiliano offered something different.

He spoke about loyalty, about taking care of your own, about building something that would last beyond your individual life. He emphasized action over feeling—it wasn't enough to love someone in your heart, you had to demonstrate that love through sacrifice and commitment and daily effort.

This resonated powerfully. People were exhausted by the loneliness of modern life, by the breakdown of social structures, by the feeling that everyone was competing rather than cooperating. Emiliano's message of family—extended family, chosen family, organizational family—gave them something to belong to, something larger than themselves.

And Joseph Clayton served as a great example, being Emiliano's spokesperson on several occasions of showcasing the next pharmaceutical electronics product from the corporate world.

Joseph was perfect for this role. He embodied the family values message completely—six wives, dozens of children, a household that functioned as a unit, relationships maintained through active love and constant attention. He was living proof that Emiliano's philosophy worked, that romanticism and reproduction and family could coexist with commercial success and material prosperity.

When Emiliano needed to launch a new product—pharmaceuticals or electronics or some hybrid of both, the legitimate face of his empire—Joseph would stand on stage and talk about family. About how the product would help families, would bring people together, would support the values that made life worth living.

"This isn't just a product," Joseph would say, his six wives sitting in the front row, his children scattered throughout the audience. "This is a tool for building the future. For creating families that are healthy, happy, connected. For ensuring that our children inherit something better than what we received."

The pharmaceutical electronics products were often vague in their actual function—devices that monitored health metrics and delivered medications, apps that connected family members and tracked wellness, systems that integrated medical care with daily living. But the specifics didn't matter as much as the narrative Joseph wove around them.

He spoke of his own family, of how these products had helped him manage the complex logistics of six wives and their various children, of how technology could serve human connection rather than replace it, of how capitalism and family values weren't opposed but could support each other.

The audiences loved him. He was handsome, sincere, obviously devoted to his wives and children. He represented a kind of masculinity that was both traditional and modern—the patriarch who provided and protected, but who also changed diapers and attended school plays and knew each child's favorite ice cream flavor.

And because Joseph was Emiliano's spokesman, because he appeared at Emiliano's events and endorsed Emiliano's products and embodied Emiliano's values, the association transferred. People who loved Joseph felt positively about Emiliano. People who aspired to Joseph's family success became loyal to Emiliano's organization.

It was righteous populism—populism that wasn't based on demagoguery or hate or scapegoating, but on positive values, on building rather than destroying, on offering people something to move toward rather than just something to be against.

Richard Pham's populism—to the extent he'd ever attempted it—had been negative, reactionary, based on grievances and enemies and everything that was wrong with the world. It had attracted no one except other broken people, other paranoid isolated individuals who saw enemies everywhere and trusted no one.

Joseph's populism—filtered through Emiliano's vision and organization—was positive, aspirational, based on family and love and building communities that would endure. It attracted normal people, functional people, individuals who wanted to be part of something larger without sacrificing their humanity or dignity.

Emiliano himself rarely appeared at these product launches. He operated from behind the scenes, letting Joseph be the public face, maintaining his own mystique and deniability. But everyone knew that Joseph spoke for Emiliano, that the values Joseph articulated were Emiliano's values, that the organization Joseph represented was ultimately Emiliano's creation.

The righteous populism worked because it was partially genuine. Emiliano really did believe in family, in loyalty, in building something that would last. His methods were criminal, his empire was built on drugs and violence and corruption, but his values—at least the ones he promoted publicly—were wholesome, traditional, appealing to people across the political and cultural spectrum.

Left-wing people appreciated the emphasis on community and mutual support. Right-wing people loved the traditional family values and religious framework. Immigrants identified with the story of building something from nothing. Native-born Americans appreciated the emphasis on stability and continuity.

It was populism that transcended traditional political categories, that spoke to fundamental human needs that ideological frameworks often missed—the need to belong, to be part of something meaningful, to build and protect and pass something on to future generations.

Richard Pham, alone in his extremist networks, speaking to no one, trusted by no one, building nothing except paranoia and resentment—he was the anti-populist, the cautionary tale of what happened when you rejected connection and community and love.

Joseph Clayton, surrounded by his wives and children, speaking to audiences of thousands, embodying values that resonated across cultural boundaries—he was the populist success story, proof that Emiliano's model worked.

And Emiliano, orchestrating it all from behind the scenes, using figures from his life to teach morality and guide his empire, building a movement that would outlast him—he was the righteous populist, the leader who understood that power ultimately rested on giving people what they genuinely needed rather than just manipulating their fears and hatreds.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these men who built families and empires, who spoke of love and loyalty while operating in shadows and violence.

Of fiction and fantasia, these lives that demonstrated how populism could be righteous rather than demagogic, how leadership could be based on positive vision rather than negative grievance.

And in the torment and triumph of Emiliano's rise to power, his righteous populism—his ability to speak to and for the people, to articulate their desires, to build organizations based on trust and family and active love—stood as one of his greatest achievements.

Greater than his wealth, more important than his criminal empire, more lasting than any individual product or operation—his populism created a movement that would persist long after he was gone, that would reshape American culture in ways that went far beyond the drug trade or money laundering or political corruption.

He gave people something to believe in.

And in an age of cynicism and isolation and atomization, that was the most valuable commodity of all.

Such was Emiliano's righteous populism.

Built on truth and lies, on family values and criminal enterprises, on genuine love and strategic manipulation.

But effective nonetheless.

And righteous, in its way.

Because it gave people what they needed, even if it came from someone whose hands were stained with blood and whose empire was built on suffering.

Righteous populism.

The ultimate tool of the romantic who would rule the world.

## Emiliano The Stable Bastion

It was a few months before Richard Pham changed his name to Tensuramoto, then fully defecting to the East to work for militant Eastern interests.

The transformation had been coming for years, visible to anyone who'd been paying attention. But in those final months before the full defection, Richard became more erratic, more openly hostile to Western civilization, more committed to the idea that only the East offered any path forward for someone like him.

He stopped pretending. Stopped maintaining the fiction that he was still an American, still loyal to Western interests, still operating within any framework that the West would recognize as legitimate. The mask came off, and what was underneath was something that had been forged in isolation and resentment and years of systematic rejection.

Richard Pham had noticed a remarkable pattern going on, and he was not afraid to talk to like-minded people about it. The pattern was systematic destabilization.

He'd compiled evidence, built models, created presentations that he shared on encrypted forums and in meetings with extremist contacts. The destabilization wasn't random, he insisted. It was orchestrated, deliberate, a strategy by Western elites to maintain control even as their power eroded.

"Look at the pattern," he'd say, his voice intense, his eyes burning with the certainty of someone who'd found the hidden truth. "Every time a region stabilizes, every time people start building something independent, the West intervenes. They call it promoting democracy or fighting terrorism, but it's always the same result—chaos, fragmentation, dependence."

The like-minded people—other radicals, other alienated intellectuals, other men who'd been rejected by the systems they'd tried to join—nodded along. They saw the pattern too, or thought they did, or wanted to believe they did because it gave meaning to their own failures and grievances.

It was about twenty-five years since 9/11.

A quarter century since the event that had reshaped global politics, that had launched the War on Terror, that had accelerated the very trends that now seemed to be reaching some kind of culmination. The world of 2026 was unrecognizable compared to 2001—fractured, multipolar, uncertain in ways that the immediate post-Cold War period had never been.

The global economy had split into alternative currencies.

The dollar was still dominant, but no longer hegemonic. The Chinese yuan had established itself as a legitimate alternative for international trade. Cryptocurrency had moved from fringe speculation to mainstream infrastructure. Regional currency blocs had formed—the Euro struggling but surviving, BRICS nations coordinating their own system, even some Middle Eastern states launching their own petroleum-backed currencies.

The fragmentation meant that economic power was more distributed, that no single nation or bloc could control global commerce the way America had for decades after World War II. It created opportunities for people like Emiliano, who could navigate between systems and convert wealth across platforms. But it also created instability, made international trade more complex, increased transaction costs and uncertainty.

Richard Pham noticed that the populace of other countries were not enjoying the same benefits of artificial intelligence as the global elitists of the West, despite how fragmented they were, marginalized and demonized by populist newcomers.

This was one of his core grievances, one of the observations that confirmed his worldview. The AI revolution had created immense wealth, had transformed entire industries, had promised to usher in a new era of prosperity and possibility.

But the benefits were concentrated almost entirely in the West—and even within the West, concentrated among a tiny elite. Tech billionaires in Silicon Valley and their counterparts in a few other global cities had captured nearly all the gains. Everyone else—the developing world, the working class in developed countries, the people who'd been promised that automation would free them from drudgery—got nothing except unemployment and economic precarity.

"They sold us a lie," Richard would say. "They said AI would benefit everyone. Instead, it's just another tool for consolidating power, for extracting wealth from the many to enrich the few. And the worst part is that the elites are fragmented now, fighting each other, but they still have more in common with each other than they do with any of us. They're marginalized by populists but still living in luxury while the rest of the world burns."

Southeast Asia had become a region of small-scale guerrilla wars.

The stability that had characterized much of the region for decades had collapsed. Myanmar's civil war had expanded, spilling over borders. Thailand was fracturing along ethnic and political lines. Indonesia faced separatist movements that had grown more violent and capable. The Philippines dealt with renewed insurgencies in the south.

None of it was large-scale conventional warfare—no armies facing off, no major battles that made international headlines. Instead, it was asymmetric, guerrilla conflicts—ambushes and assassinations, bombings and kidnappings, territories that changed hands constantly without clear front lines or decisive victories.

It was the kind of warfare that Richard understood, that his extremist networks thrived in, that created opportunities for people willing to operate outside normal rules.

Japan was rebuilding its military, and South Korea had defected over to China, as part of a reunification pact with the North.

The geopolitical earthquake that was Korean reunification under Chinese auspices had shocked the world. After decades of the North and South being enemies, separated by ideology and militarism, they'd found common cause in rejecting American influence and accepting Chinese hegemony.

The reunification pact had been negotiated secretly, announced suddenly, implemented rapidly before the West could organize meaningful opposition. China had guaranteed security and economic support. The Kim dynasty had agreed to integrate into a larger Korean state with significant autonomy but ultimate Chinese oversight. South Korea's government—tired of dependence on an America that seemed increasingly unreliable—had accepted the arrangement as the best available option.

Japan, watching its traditional ally align with its historical rival, had responded by accelerating military buildup that had been constrained since World War II. The pacifist constitution was effectively dead. Japan was becoming a normal country again—which meant a militarized country, a country preparing for conflict, a country that no longer trusted America to guarantee its security.

Russia had recovered from its war with Ukraine, and was quietly centralizing its power to stabilize its neighboring states.

The war had been costly, longer and more brutal than anyone expected. But Russia had ultimately prevailed through sheer willingness to absorb casualties and economic damage that Western countries couldn't imagine accepting. Ukraine had been devastated, had lost territory, had been forced into an settlement that gave Russia most of what it wanted.

Now Russia was consolidating, moving into former Soviet states that had tried to maintain independence, establishing control over Central Asia and the Caucasus, creating a sphere of influence that resembled the old empire. It was done quietly, with less fanfare than the Ukraine war, with a focus on stability rather than conquest.

The message was clear: Russia was back, was a power that had to be reckoned with, was establishing an order in its region that the West would have to accept because the West lacked the will or capability to challenge it.

In the meantime, Richard Pham saw a lot of civil discontent from the American populace.

America was fracturing in ways that went beyond normal political division. The hispanicization that had benefited Emiliano had created backlash from those who felt displaced. The AI revolution had created unemployment and inequality that no policy seemed able to address. The cultural wars had intensified to the point where different regions of the country barely recognized each other as part of the same nation.

There were protests, riots, increasing political violence. Federal authority was weak, contested, unable to maintain order in regions where local populations had decided they no longer recognized its legitimacy. The Mujahideen and Vietcong affiliates that had established zones of control were just the most extreme example—there were other areas where militias, cartels, corporate security forces, or religious organizations exercised more real power than the official government.

He knew things could be worse, and he could be further destabilized.

Richard's position was precarious. He was operating in dangerous spaces, dealing with people who would kill him without hesitation if they decided he was more valuable dead than alive. His usefulness to Emiliano was declining as his radicalization increased. The intelligence agencies that had tried to kill him before were still looking for him, still considering him a target.

He could feel the walls closing in, could sense that his current situation wasn't sustainable, that he needed to make a move before circumstances forced one on him.

Sensing that things would not improve, Richard Pham changed his name to Tensuramoto, defecting to an Eastern faction once and for all.

The name change was ceremonial, symbolic—a final rejection of his Vietnamese heritage, his American upbringing, everything that had defined him before. Tensuramoto sounded vaguely Japanese, though it wasn't a real Japanese name, just a construction that suggested Eastern identity without committing to any specific nation or ethnicity.

The defection was complete. He moved to territory controlled by Chinese-aligned forces, offered his services formally to organizations that were openly hostile to Western interests, burned every bridge that might have allowed him to return to anything resembling his former life.

"The East is the East, and the West the West," he'd written in a final message to Emiliano. A reference to Kipling, that colonial poet who'd declared the two could never meet. Tensuramoto believed it now—believed that the division was fundamental, unbridgeable, that you had to choose a side and commit to it completely.

He'd chosen the East. And Emiliano, reading the message, had felt no surprise, no regret, just a mild satisfaction that the problem had resolved itself.

Emiliano, the intelligent and wary man that he was, looked to Joshua Polanski and Esteban Hernandez as replacement.

He'd seen Tensuramoto's defection coming, had been preparing for months. The encrypted communications had become unreliable, the intelligence suspect, the loyalty obviously compromised. Emiliano had already started shifting responsibilities, reducing Tensuramoto's access to sensitive information, building redundancy into networks that had depended on him.

Joshua and Esteban were the obvious replacements. They lacked Tensuramoto's technical expertise and his access to Eastern networks, but they compensated with loyalty, stability, and genuine commitment to Emiliano's vision.

They would more than fill in the role of Tensuramoto, since Tensuramoto had been feeding his associates bogus information going back a couple years before his full defection.

This was the part that concerned Emiliano most. Not that Tensuramoto had left—that was fine, even beneficial given how unstable he'd become. But that he'd been compromised for years, had been deliberately providing false intelligence, had been sabotaging operations while pretending to facilitate them.

How much damage had he done? How many decisions had been based on his bogus information? How many opportunities had been missed, how many threats had materialized, because Tensuramoto was playing a double game?

Emiliano had his analysts going through everything, trying to separate truth from lies, trying to assess which operations had been compromised. It was exhausting, expensive, potentially catastrophic.

But it also confirmed what Emiliano had suspected—that Tensuramoto's worldview had become so rigid that he couldn't function effectively anymore. "The East is the East, and the West the West"—this binary thinking, this inability to navigate complexity, this commitment to choosing sides rather than playing all sides—it made Tensuramoto useless for the kind of work Emiliano needed done.

Joshua Polanski and Esteban Hernandez, on the other hand, cautious of Eastern resurgence, raised by Western society, married hand in hand through thick and thin, found a sense of both loyalty and opportunity to conduct business dealings and oversee business operations for Emiliano. In the Western hemisphere, of course.

They were perfect for the role, in their way. They understood Western culture instinctively, had been raised in it, had succeeded within its structures. They were cautious about the East—not hostile exactly, but aware of the risks, unwilling to commit to relationships that might compromise their primary loyalty to Emiliano and to the Western networks they operated within.

Their marriage—legal now, celebrated rather than hidden—gave them stability that Tensuramoto had never achieved. They had each other, had a home, had a life outside of the work. This made them more reliable, less likely to radicalize or defect, more capable of maintaining perspective when operations became stressful.

And they saw opportunity in the role. Tensuramoto's defection created a vacuum that needed to be filled, and filling it meant advancement, responsibility, access to higher levels of the organization. They were ambitious but not reckless, wanted success but were willing to earn it rather than demanding it immediately.

"We'll handle the Western operations," Joshua told Emiliano when they discussed the transition. "Everything in the Americas, Europe, the traditional networks. We'll leave the Eastern operations to someone else—or maybe you scale them back, operate more carefully there until you find someone you can really trust."

It was good advice. Emiliano took it.

Emiliano was still rising in power, despite the geopolitical uncertainty. In fact, it was the uncertainty that so conveniently paved the way for Emiliano to take over the reigns for the era's sick men of Europe: the UK, Germany.

The European powers that had once dominated the world were now in decline—economically stagnant, politically paralyzed, culturally exhausted. The UK was dealing with the ongoing fallout from Brexit, with Scotland threatening independence, with an economy that had never recovered its former dynamism. Germany was struggling with demographic decline, with energy dependence that the Russian war had exposed, with a political system that couldn't make difficult decisions.

They were sick men, the way the Ottoman Empire had been called the sick man of Europe in the 19th century. Declining powers that everyone knew were declining but that maintained the fiction of continued relevance because the alternative was too painful to acknowledge.

And into that decline, Emiliano moved. His networks, his capital, his ability to provide what their failing systems couldn't—stability, opportunity, connections that transcended their weakened political structures.

He bought property in London and Berlin, invested in businesses that European governments could no longer support, provided financing that traditional banks were too risk-averse to offer. He hired their unemployed youth, offered opportunities to their educated professionals who saw no future in their home countries, built networks that were more effective than their sclerotic governmental institutions.

The uncertainty—the fragmentation of the global economy, the rise of alternative power centers, the collapse of American hegemony that had guaranteed European security for decades—created space for someone like Emiliano to operate. Where everything was uncertain, where traditional structures were failing, where old rules no longer applied, a man with resources and vision and the willingness to act could reshape entire regions.

Emiliano became a stable bastion in an unstable world. While Tensuramoto chased ideological purity in Eastern extremist networks, while European governments dithered and declined, while American populace tore itself apart over cultural conflicts, Emiliano built.

He built businesses that employed people. He built networks that connected regions and cultures. He built systems that provided stability and opportunity in a world that seemed to offer neither.

Yes, it was built on drugs and violence and corruption. Yes, the stability he offered came at the cost of law and legitimate authority. Yes, the opportunities he created were entangled with criminal enterprises that destroyed as many lives as they improved.

But to the people who worked for him, who depended on him, who saw him as the only thing standing between them and chaos—he was the bastion, the stable center, the force that made life livable in an increasingly unlivable world.

Joshua and Esteban understood this. They saw how Emiliano operated, how he positioned himself as the solution to problems that governments couldn't solve, how he filled vacuums that official institutions left empty.

"We're not replacing Tensuramoto," Esteban said to Joshua one night, as they reviewed the operations they'd inherited. "We're building something different. Something better. Something that serves the Western hemisphere the way Tensuramoto thought he was serving the East."

"Except we're not going to defect," Joshua added. "We're not going to radicalize. We're going to stay loyal, stay stable, stay focused on building rather than destroying."

It was a commitment they kept. Over the years that followed, as the world continued fracturing, as the East-West divide deepened, as America went through convulsions that seemed like they might tear the country apart, Joshua and Esteban remained loyal to Emiliano, remained stable bastions themselves within his larger stable bastion.

They oversaw Western operations efficiently, expanded into European markets as traditional powers declined, built networks that would outlast the geopolitical crises that were remaking the world order.

And Emiliano, watching all of this, managing it from his penthouse in Tampa, saw that he'd made the right choice. Tensuramoto had been brilliant but broken, useful but ultimately unstable. Joshua and Esteban were less brilliant perhaps, but infinitely more reliable, capable of building rather than just destroying, committed to something beyond their own grievances and ideologies.

Such utter romantics of Florida, these men who built empires while the world burned around them.

Of fiction and fantasia, these lives that demonstrated how stability could be found in chaos, how opportunity could be created from crisis, how bastions could be built even—especially—in times of systematic destabilization.

And in the torment and triumph of Emiliano's continued rise to power, his role as stable bastion stood as perhaps his greatest achievement. Not his wealth, not his criminal success, not his ability to corrupt and control, but his provision of stability and structure in a world that was losing both.

Tensuramoto had chosen ideology over stability, the East over the West, destruction over building. And he would die for that choice—alone, in Jakarta, killed by associates Emiliano sent because Tensuramoto had become too dangerous, too unstable, too compromised to remain useful.

Joshua and Esteban chose loyalty over ideology, building over destroying, the difficult work of maintaining organizations over the easy satisfaction of burning them down. And they would thrive, would become pillars of Emiliano's empire, would inherit significant portions of it when he eventually died.

The choice was always there, always available to everyone.

Stability or chaos. Building or destroying. Loyalty or ideology. West or East.

Emiliano chose stability, building, loyalty to his vision rather than to abstract ideologies. And he became the bastion, the stable center that held while everything else spun apart.

It was about twenty-five years since 9/11, and the world was more fractured than ever.

But Emiliano was more powerful than ever.

And the stability he provided—criminal, corrupt, built on suffering—was still stability.

Still a bastion.

Still better than chaos.

Such was Emiliano the Stable Bastion, standing firm while the world systematically destabilized around him.

Righteous in his own way.

Monstrous in most others.

But stable.

Always stable.

The bastion that held.
