# CHAPTER 1
The Birth of Emiliano

"Emiliano's power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world."

The midwife's hands trembled as she caught the infant, not from inexperience—she had delivered hundreds of babies along the mangrove-tangled coast of Florida—but from the strange heat radiating from the child's skin. It was August, the air thick as wet wool, yet this warmth was different. It pulsed.

"Dios mío," she whispered, crossing herself with slick fingers.

Maria Consuela Reyes had labored for fourteen hours in the back room of her father's fish house in Tarpon Springs. The smell of salt and mullet hung in the air, mixing with her sweat and the iron scent of birth. Outside, the Gulf of Mexico whispered against the docks, and pelicans called to one another in the dying light.

When Emiliano finally emerged into the world, he did not cry. His eyes—dark as the water at midnight—opened immediately, fixing on his mother's face with an intensity that made her catch her breath. In that moment, Maria felt something pass between them, a current of recognition that transcended the ordinary bond between mother and child.

"Is he well?" she gasped, reaching for him.

The midwife hesitated, then placed the boy on Maria's chest. "He is... perfect," she said, though her voice carried a note of uncertainty. "More than perfect."

Maria's husband, Santiago, stood in the doorway, his sponge-diver's shoulders filling the frame. He had been born in Greece, had come to Florida chasing the same underwater fortune as thousands of others, and had learned to read the sea's moods the way other men read newspapers. Now, looking at his newborn son, he felt that same instinctive knowledge stirring in his gut—the sense that something profound had shifted in the world.

"What will you call him?" the midwife asked, washing her hands in a basin of water that steamed despite the August heat.

"Emiliano," Maria said without hesitation. The name had come to her in dreams during her pregnancy, whispered by voices she could not quite hear, in a language she did not quite understand. "Emiliano Santiago Reyes."

The baby's tiny hand opened and closed, as if grasping at invisible threads in the air. Later, the midwife would tell her sister that she had seen something flickering around those small fingers—a shimmer like heat rising from sun-baked sand, or the aurora of St. Elmo's fire that sometimes danced on the masts of ships before a storm. But in the moment, she said nothing. Some things were better left unspoken.

That night, while Maria slept with Emiliano curled against her side, Santiago walked down to the docks. The moon was full, painting a silver road across the black water. He lit a cigarette and watched the smoke curl into the darkness, thinking about his son, about the strange sensation he had felt in that birthing room—as if the air itself had been holding its breath.

A pelican landed on a nearby piling, its prehistoric profile sharp against the stars. It regarded Santiago with one ancient eye, and for a moment, the sponge diver had the absurd feeling that the bird knew something he did not.

"You felt it too," he said aloud, surprising himself.

The pelican said nothing, of course. But it did not fly away either. It simply watched, as if waiting for something inevitable to begin.

In the fish house, Emiliano dreamed. Though newborns are not supposed to dream in the way that children and adults do, this one did. He dreamed of fire and water, of light bending through crystal, of patterns hidden in chaos. He dreamed of a power sleeping in his blood, ancient and patient, waiting for the day when he would be old enough to understand what he had been born to do.

Florida had seen many strange births in its long, wild history. The land itself had been born from limestone and time, sculpted by water and wind into something neither quite solid nor quite liquid. It was a place of in-betweens, of boundaries where one thing became another. Freshwater met salt. Land dissolved into sea. Reality grew thin in the subtropical heat, and sometimes—just sometimes—the impossible leaked through.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes was born in that liminal space, in that hour when day surrenders to night, in that place where the continent gives way to the ocean. And from the moment he drew his first breath, the world began to bend around him, waiting to see what shape his power would take.

The midwife burned sage in her home that night, though she could not have said exactly why. She simply knew, in the way that certain people know things, that she had witnessed the beginning of something that would echo far beyond the small fishing town of Tarpon Springs, far beyond the mangrove coast of Florida, far beyond any distance that could be measured in miles.

History, after all, is not made by the passage of time alone. It is made by the people who step into its current and change its course. And Emiliano, barely hours old, sleeping peacefully in his mother's arms, had already begun to stir those waters.

His power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world.

But he was.

And everything that followed—every miracle, every catastrophe, every impossible moment—began in that small room above the fish house, on that August night, when a child with fire in his blood opened his eyes and looked upon Florida for the first time.
