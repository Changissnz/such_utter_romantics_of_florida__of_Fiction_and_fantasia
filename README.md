## The Birth of Emiliano

"Emiliano's power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world."

The midwife's hands trembled as she caught the infant, not from inexperience—she had delivered hundreds of babies along the mangrove-tangled coast of Florida—but from the strange heat radiating from the child's skin. It was August, the air thick as wet wool, yet this warmth was different. It pulsed.

"Dios mío," she whispered, crossing herself with slick fingers.

Maria Consuela Reyes had labored for fourteen hours in the back room of her father's fish house in Tarpon Springs. The smell of salt and mullet hung in the air, mixing with her sweat and the iron scent of birth. Outside, the Gulf of Mexico whispered against the docks, and pelicans called to one another in the dying light.

When Emiliano finally emerged into the world, he did not cry. His eyes—dark as the water at midnight—opened immediately, fixing on his mother's face with an intensity that made her catch her breath. In that moment, Maria felt something pass between them, a current of recognition that transcended the ordinary bond between mother and child.

"Is he well?" she gasped, reaching for him.

The midwife hesitated, then placed the boy on Maria's chest. "He is... perfect," she said, though her voice carried a note of uncertainty. "More than perfect."

Maria's husband, Santiago, stood in the doorway, his sponge-diver's shoulders filling the frame. He had been born in Greece, had come to Florida chasing the same underwater fortune as thousands of others, and had learned to read the sea's moods the way other men read newspapers. Now, looking at his newborn son, he felt that same instinctive knowledge stirring in his gut—the sense that something profound had shifted in the world.

"What will you call him?" the midwife asked, washing her hands in a basin of water that steamed despite the August heat.

"Emiliano," Maria said without hesitation. The name had come to her in dreams during her pregnancy, whispered by voices she could not quite hear, in a language she did not quite understand. "Emiliano Santiago Reyes."

The baby's tiny hand opened and closed, as if grasping at invisible threads in the air. Later, the midwife would tell her sister that she had seen something flickering around those small fingers—a shimmer like heat rising from sun-baked sand, or the aurora of St. Elmo's fire that sometimes danced on the masts of ships before a storm. But in the moment, she said nothing. Some things were better left unspoken.

That night, while Maria slept with Emiliano curled against her side, Santiago walked down to the docks. The moon was full, painting a silver road across the black water. He lit a cigarette and watched the smoke curl into the darkness, thinking about his son, about the strange sensation he had felt in that birthing room—as if the air itself had been holding its breath.

A pelican landed on a nearby piling, its prehistoric profile sharp against the stars. It regarded Santiago with one ancient eye, and for a moment, the sponge diver had the absurd feeling that the bird knew something he did not.

"You felt it too," he said aloud, surprising himself.

The pelican said nothing, of course. But it did not fly away either. It simply watched, as if waiting for something inevitable to begin.

In the fish house, Emiliano dreamed. Though newborns are not supposed to dream in the way that children and adults do, this one did. He dreamed of fire and water, of light bending through crystal, of patterns hidden in chaos. He dreamed of a power sleeping in his blood, ancient and patient, waiting for the day when he would be old enough to understand what he had been born to do.

Florida had seen many strange births in its long, wild history. The land itself had been born from limestone and time, sculpted by water and wind into something neither quite solid nor quite liquid. It was a place of in-betweens, of boundaries where one thing became another. Freshwater met salt. Land dissolved into sea. Reality grew thin in the subtropical heat, and sometimes—just sometimes—the impossible leaked through.

Emiliano Santiago Reyes was born in that liminal space, in that hour when day surrenders to night, in that place where the continent gives way to the ocean. And from the moment he drew his first breath, the world began to bend around him, waiting to see what shape his power would take.

The midwife burned sage in her home that night, though she could not have said exactly why. She simply knew, in the way that certain people know things, that she had witnessed the beginning of something that would echo far beyond the small fishing town of Tarpon Springs, far beyond the mangrove coast of Florida, far beyond any distance that could be measured in miles.

History, after all, is not made by the passage of time alone. It is made by the people who step into its current and change its course. And Emiliano, barely hours old, sleeping peacefully in his mother's arms, had already begun to stir those waters.

His power would never have made history if he were not brought into this world.

But he was.

And everything that followed—every miracle, every catastrophe, every impossible moment—began in that small room above the fish house, on that August night, when a child with fire in his blood opened his eyes and looked upon Florida for the first time.

## CH.2
Emiliano's First Love

Emiliano's first girlfriend was Brittany Cluetrick. It was as easy for Emiliano to have sex with Cluetrick as it was for him to fist her. He was suave and outgoing, and gentle until he was not. Polite, intelligent, and was Cluetrick's top pick for ethnic boyfriend.

They met in AP Literature during junior year at Clearwater High School. Emiliano had grown into his features by then—the dark eyes that had unsettled the midwife now drew admiring glances, and the heat that had pulsed from his infant skin had transformed into a different kind of magnetism. He wore it like a second skin, this charm, this ability to make people lean closer when he spoke.

Brittany Cluetrick sat two rows ahead of him, her blonde hair always pulled into a perfect ponytail that swung when she turned to look at him. She was captain of the debate team, president of the Honor Society, and possessed the kind of confidence that came from never having been told no. Her family had money—old Florida money, the kind that came from phosphate mines and cattle ranches, before the state became a destination for snowbirds and theme parks.

"You're Emiliano, right?" she said after class one October afternoon, her blue eyes appraising him with an openness that might have been flattering or predatory, depending on how you looked at it. "You write really well. Your essay on Gatsby was actually interesting."

"Thanks," he said, slinging his backpack over one shoulder. "You're Brittany."

"I am." She smiled, showing perfectly straight teeth. "We should study together sometime. For the midterm."

They both knew she didn't need help studying. Brittany Cluetrick had never scored below a 95 on anything in her life. But Emiliano understood the game being played, had understood it instinctively from the moment she'd approached him.

"Sure," he said. "When?"

That Friday, they met at her house—a sprawling ranch-style home in a gated community where the lawns were maintained by landscaping crews and the driveways held German cars. Her parents were in Tampa for the weekend, attending some charity gala. They had the house to themselves.

They studied for maybe twenty minutes, textbooks open on the kitchen island, before Brittany closed her copy of The Great Gatsby and looked at him directly.

"You know," she said, "I've never dated anyone like you before."

"Like me?"

"You know. Ethnic." She said it casually, as if commenting on the weather, as if the word didn't carry the weight of every assumption she'd ever made about people who didn't look like her family photos. "My parents would have a fit."

Emiliano set down his pen. He could have been offended. Should have been, maybe. But he'd learned early that offense was a luxury for people who didn't understand how power worked. Instead, he smiled.

"That's part of the appeal, isn't it?" he said. "The fact that they'd have a fit."

Brittany's smile widened. "Maybe."

What followed was inevitable in the way that certain chemical reactions are inevitable once you combine the right elements. They came together with an intensity that surprised both of them, though for different reasons. For Brittany, it was the thrill of transgression, of claiming something her parents' world had taught her to admire from a distance but never touch. For Emiliano, it was something else—a testing of boundaries, an exploration of the power he'd always felt coiled inside him but never quite understood.

He was gentle with her at first, polite in the way his mother had taught him to be with all people, regardless of whether they deserved it. But Brittany didn't want gentle. She wanted to be consumed, to feel something that contradicted every safe, sanitized experience her privileged life had offered her.

"Don't treat me like I'm breakable," she whispered against his mouth, her nails digging into his shoulders.

So he didn't.

Their relationship became a pattern of escalation. Each encounter pushed further than the last, testing limits that Brittany had never known she had. Emiliano discovered that he possessed an intuitive understanding of what she wanted before she could articulate it—the same way his father could read the sea, he could read the currents of desire and submission that flowed beneath the surface of every interaction.

It was as easy for him to have sex with her as it was to take her apart completely, to reduce her to nothing but sensation and surrender. She craved it, this dissolution of the self-control she maintained everywhere else in her life. With him, she could be something other than Brittany Cluetrick, Honor Society president and future Yale student. She could be raw and unfinished and desperate.

At school, they maintained a careful distance. Brittany had her reputation to consider, after all. But in private—in her empty house, in his car parked by the beach at midnight, in the borrowed apartment of a friend who asked no questions—they were something else entirely. Something that couldn't be easily categorized or explained.

"I like that you're not like the other guys," she told him once, lying tangled in her sheets while her parents attended another weekend function. "You're smart. You actually read. You're not just some..."

She trailed off, but Emiliano heard the end of the sentence anyway. Not just some stereotype. Not just some fantasy. Not just some exotic diversion.

Except that's exactly what he was to her, and they both knew it.

He didn't mind, not really. Because she was something to him too—a door into a world that had always existed adjacent to his own but never quite intersected with it. Through Brittany, he learned how the other half lived, how they spoke about people like his family when they thought no one was listening, how they collected experiences and relationships the way his mother collected seashells on the beach.

Their relationship lasted seven months, which was longer than anyone expected but shorter than Brittany had probably hoped. It ended not with drama but with inevitability, the way tides turn not because of any single wave but because the moon pulls them in a different direction.

"I'm going to Yale in the fall," she said in May, as if this were news, as if they hadn't both known from the beginning that this had an expiration date.

"I know," Emiliano said.

"And you're... what, staying here? Going to community college?"

"University of Florida," he corrected. "Full scholarship."

"Oh. That's good." She said it in a tone that suggested it wasn't good enough, that nothing in Florida could ever be good enough for someone who'd been accepted to the Ivy League.

They had sex one last time, in her bedroom with the windows open and the smell of jasmine drifting in from the garden her mother's landscapers maintained. It was different than usual—less intense, more perfunctory, as if they were both going through motions they'd memorized but no longer felt.

Afterward, Brittany lay with her head on his chest and said, "I'll remember you, you know. When I'm up there."

Emiliano stared at the ceiling fan turning lazy circles overhead. "Will you?"

"Yeah. You were... important. To me. You were my first... a lot of things."

He didn't ask what things. He already knew. First ethnic boyfriend. First walk on the wild side. First rebellion against parental expectations. First experience of losing control. First of many stories she'd tell at college parties, edited and softened until he became a character rather than a person.

"You were important to me too," he said, because it was true, even if the importance was different than she imagined.

They didn't stay in touch. Brittany went to Yale and joined a sorority and dated a lacrosse player named Chip or Chad or something equally predictable. Emiliano saw her Instagram posts occasionally—perfectly curated photos of ivy-covered buildings and autumn leaves and friends who all looked like variations of her.

But sometimes, late at night when he was alone, he thought about what he'd learned from Brittany Cluetrick. Not just about sex or desire or the performance of intimacy, but about power. About how easily people gave it away when you understood what they wanted, what they needed, what they'd never admit to needing.

He'd been gentle with her until he wasn't. Polite until politeness became another form of cruelty. Intelligent enough to see exactly what she was offering and smart enough to take it without attachment.

Brittany had chosen him as her top pick for ethnic boyfriend, collecting him like a trophy, a story, a temporary deviation from the path her life was always meant to follow.

But in the process, she'd taught him something valuable about the nature of power and desire, about the way people could be taken apart and reassembled, about the difference between what people said they wanted and what they actually craved.

It was a lesson he would carry with him long after her name became just another entry in the catalog of his past, long after her face blurred into the general category of "girls from high school," long after everything else that would follow in the strange and impossible story of Emiliano Santiago Reyes.

His first love had been a transaction, an education, a prelude.

And like everything else in his life, it had been touched by that power sleeping in his blood, waiting to wake fully, waiting to show him what he was truly capable of becoming.
